# Responsible Datasets in Context

Website: http://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/

This website contains a repository of curated datasets that are paired with rich documentation, related essays, and teaching resources. 

We dig into the **social and historical context** of each dataset, and we provide extensive documentation about the data's **provenance and limitations**. We also include teaching resources for each dataset—such as **programming exercises**, **discussion questions**, **lessons plans**, and more—to enable their integration into the classroom.

By providing these contextual materials, we hope to promote the responsible use of these particular datasets for teaching and research in humanities and data science contexts. We also seek to promote the responsible use of data more broadly—whether in the classroom, industry, or the wider world—by underscoring the significance of context in all data-related work.
