    "text": "Responsible Datasets in Context\nStar this project on Github\n\nThis website contains a repository of curated datasets that are paired with rich documentation, related essays, and teaching resources.\nWe dig into the social and historical context of each dataset, and we provide extensive documentation about the data‚Äôs provenance and limitations. We also include teaching resources for each dataset‚Äîsuch as programming exercises, discussion questions, lessons plans, and more‚Äîto enable their integration into the classroom.\nBy providing these contextual materials, we hope to promote the responsible use of these particular datasets for teaching and research in humanities and data science contexts. We also seek to promote the responsible use of data more broadly‚Äîwhether in the classroom, industry, or the wider world‚Äîby underscoring the significance of context in all data-related work.\n\n\n\n\nüöß Website Under Construction üöß\nThis website is currently under construction.

How do historical biases in systems of literary production, preservation, and circulation figure into these kinds of claims? And how do we even define what counts as a novel?\nTo contextualize the initial list and dig into its claims about literary greatness, we collected information on each novel from a number of other databases, including Wikipedia, Goodreads, Project Gutenberg, the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), and Classify (a now-shuttered OCLC tool), which we have compiled here.\nThe dataset was created by Anna Preus and Aashna Sheth, who are also the authors of this data essay."

    "section": "HISTORY",
    "text": "HISTORY\nTo start, what is a novel? Today, novels are so prevalent that the term is often applied to a much wider range of books than it actually describes. ‚ÄúNovel‚Äù is an umbrella term for works of longform fiction in a range of genres: romance, sci-fi, historical fiction, horror, detective fiction, westerns, etc. The term generally does not apply‚Äìalthough these distinctions can sometimes be fuzzy‚Äìto short fiction, poetry, plays, biographies, or other non-fiction forms. The word ‚Äúnovel‚Äù was first used to describe a ‚Äúlong fictional prose narrative‚Äù in the 1600s, and the form increased in popularity across the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Interestingly, OCLC‚Äôs list of top 500 novels extends much further back than this. The oldest work on the list is The Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature written over 1,000 years ago.\nA key issue in literary studies is which books from the past we continue to read in the present, and which books from the present we will continue to read in the future. The vast majority of novels fall out of circulation shortly after they are published, quickly becoming part of what Margaret Cohen has called ‚Äúthe great unread.‚Äù When teachers assign texts in their classes and when literary scholars conduct research, they‚Äôre making choices about which texts continue to be valuable and important for people to read and study.\nThe term ‚Äúcanon‚Äù in literary studies refers to texts that continue to be considered important over time. Ankhi Mukherjee defines the canon as ‚Äúa set of texts whose value and readability have borne the test of time‚Äù noting that this ‚Äú involves not merely a work‚Äôs admission into an elite club, but its induction into ongoing critical dialogue and contestations of literary value.‚Äù Canonical works continue to be read, taught, and discussed, and in popular terminology they‚Äôre often considered ‚Äúclassics.‚Äù These are works you might read in a high school English class: F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs The Great Gatsby, for example, or Harper Lee‚Äôs To Kill a Mockingbird.\nOne of the things that defines a classic is the fact that it stays in print for a long period of time. When a book is published, it is issued in an edition with a specific number of physical copies. If the book is profitable, it may be re-issued in different editions over many years, and edited repeatedly by different scholars across time. If it becomes a classic, it is likely to be issued in dozens or hundreds of editions even long after the author‚Äôs death.\nIn addition to classics, libraries are invested in making popular new novels available to readers. The Top 500 list includes many recently published best-sellers, including books in the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games series. Some highly popular books go on to become classics‚ÄìCharles Dickens‚Äôs Great Expectations, which was wildly successful in its day, is a good example. Many popular texts, though, do not become canonical.\nBy focusing on the books that librarians around the world have chosen to continue to make available to readers, OCLC was able to create a list of widely read novels that includes both classic works and more recent, popular works that may not have received the same levels of literary acclaim. We wondered, though, how did OCLC‚Äôs data compare to other potential indicators of popularity or canonicity? And, for that matter, how was the list actually constructed?"

    "text": "WHAT‚ÄôS IN THE DATA? WHAT MAKES A BOOK A ‚ÄúTOP NOVEL‚Äù?\nThe Top 500 list represents a massive data extraction and analysis effort on the part of OCLC. While they do not provide detailed information on how the list was compiled, they do offer a brief explanation of the process that went into creating the list on their FAQ page (written in the context of the top 100, but also applies to the top 500):\n\nMaterials in libraries are described and tracked in WorldCat in two ways. Any specific work of literature, music, art, history, etc., has an associated catalog record. This describes the item in a general sense. Every copy of the same book, for example, shares the same record. WorldCat also tracks library holdings, which indicate that a specific library has (or holds) at least one copy of that item.\n\n\nThe Library 100 is based on the total number of holdings for a specific novel across all libraries that have registered that information in WorldCat. When a library tells OCLC, ‚ÄúWe have a copy of that book available,‚Äù that counts as a holding, and in the case of The Library 100, counts as +1 toward its ranking on the list.\n\nThis process initially sounds straightforward: to create the Top 500 list, the OCLC team presumably searched the title of a work, counted the number of libraries that held each title, and published the first 500. But it turns out it‚Äôs actually much more complicated than that. In WorldCat, records are stored by edition, meaning that each edition of a particular title has its own catalog record. An individual title like, say, Miguel de Cervantes‚Äôs Don Quixote, may have been released in hundreds or thousands of editions since its initial publication.\nThis means that when developing the list, the OCLC team actually had to find all the editions of a specific title and sum the number of libraries that hold that edition across all editions. Thus the top 500 list is not only a representation of how many libraries carry the work, but a representation of how many times a book has been re-edited and re-issued; the more editions a book has, the more records are created and the more copies of a book a library may hold. Often, there are duplicate records for individual editions, which may affect the overall count of copies tallied by the OCLC. And when a work is translated into different languages, all the editions of all the translations are also recorded in WorldCat, which also figures into the count of total holdings for each novel."

    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA WAS ADDED?\nWe wanted to contextualize the Library Top 500 list by compiling additional information on each novel from a range of other sources. We focused on gathering three main categories of information: information that could help us understand what types of works‚Äìand whose works‚Äìwere included on the list, data that could potentially provide alternate measures of popularity or canonicity, and the full text of each novel that was in the public domain. We collected information from the following sources:\nWorldCat: we used the now-shuttered OCLC tool Classify to gather data from WorldCat on the top 100 most widely held editions of each of the 500 novels on the list. We recorded total library holdings for these top 100 editions. We consider number of editions as a potential alternate measure of canonicity, although it is necessarily affected by the amount of time that has passed since the initial publication of the novel.\nVIAF: The Virtual International Authority File is an OCLC-run database that contains structured records‚Äìcalled ‚Äúname authority files‚Äù‚Äìfor individual authors and creators. We used VIAF to gather information on authors whose novels were included on the list, including their birth and death dates, nationalities, genders, and occupations.\n\n\n\nExamplf of author VIAF\n\n\nWikipedia: we used Wikipedia, the popular, free, volunteer-authored encyclopedia, to identify the year of first publication for each novel on the list.\nGoodreads: Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, is the largest social networking site related to books, with over 150 million members. Itt allows users to rate, review, and discuss a huge range of texts. We drew on data from Goodreads as a potential alternate indicator of texts‚Äô popularity, collecting total number of reviews, total number of ratings, and average overall rating for each novel on the list.\nProject Gutenberg: We used Project Gutenberg to access the full-text of all novels on the list that are currently in the public domain, or in other words, out of copyright. We chose Project Gutenberg because their eBooks are edited by volunteers, whereas many larger content repositories, like Internet Archive and HathiTrust, only make available machine-generated transcriptions of historical texts, which tend to be less accurate.\nOur work creating this dataset not only builds on the work of the OCLC team who compiled the Top 500 list, but on the labor of the thousands of librarians who created records held in WorldCat and VIAF, of the volunteers who transcribed texts for Project Gutenberg and wrote articles for Wikipedia, and of the social media users who reviewed and rated books on Goodreads."

    "text": "ACKNOWLEDGING BIAS\nThe Top 500 List provides an unprecedented opportunity to consider what works libraries around the world have on their shelves. This, in turn, serves as an important indicator of books‚Äô continued relevance to readers. As OCLC points out, ‚Äúlibraries offer access to trendy and popular books. But, they don‚Äôt keep them on the shelf if they‚Äôre not repeatedly requested by their communities over the years.‚Äù\nAt the same time, there are biases in what gets kept on library shelves, and in which library shelves are being considered. The libraries that OCLC works with are disproportionately located in Europe and North America and OCLC uses cataloging systems developed in English-language contexts. The list is distinctly skewed toward works by White, European and American men, as is much of the history of English literary production, but it is also difficult to tease apart this historical bias from potential compounding biases in the underlying data, in the data collection process, or in library cataloging systems more broadly.\nOCLC acknowledges broad biases in the list in a section titled, ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the list more diverse?‚Äù writing, ‚ÄúThe list emphasizes many books that we tend to think of as ‚Äòclassics,‚Äô because those are the novels most often translated, retold in different editions, taught and widely distributed in library collections. Because of this, the list tends to reflect more dominant cultural views.‚Äù Although OCLC acknowledges this general bias towards works considered classics, more specific forms of bias aren‚Äôt made apparent in the list itself, which only includes the title and author for each novel.\n\nEach of these works and authors, of course, deserves careful consideration in their own right, but by compiling additional information into dataset, we can begin to see some of these biases as well as trends across the list more clearly."

The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP"

We‚Äôll explain some specific dimensions of the collection we‚Äôve put together below, including how to search and sort through the material. Under a separate tab, we‚Äôll also suggest some possible classroom exercises that might make this collection useful for students who are learning about African American poetry for the first time.

    "section": "African American Periodical Poetry: a Bit of Background",
    "text": "African American Periodical Poetry: a Bit of Background\nIn their poetry, African American writers argued for Civil Rights, challenged the unjust practices and racialized violence that were prevalent in American life, and worked out new and distinctive aesthetic concepts. At the beginning of the twentieth century, African American poetry was not so much a ‚Äòliterary‚Äô movement as it was a part of popular culture, with hugely popular and influential figures like Paul Laurence Dunbar and an important element of African American Vernacular writing and performance linked to the oral tradition (Ramey, A History of African American Poetry, 2019). However, by the 1920s, changes in the style and function of the poetry was evident, and these changes can be readily traced in poetry published in periodicals.\nThe overall conception of this project borrows from Modernist Periodical Studies, led by scholars such as Sean Latham (‚ÄúThe Rise of Periodical Studies,‚Äù 2006), Robert Scholes and Clifford Wulfman (Modernism in the Magazines, 2010), and Adam McKible and Suzanne Churchill (Little Magazines and Modernism, 2005). It is also deeply invested in the field that has come to be known as Black Digital Humanities scholarship; we hope our work will be legible as in the vein of Kim Gallon‚Äôs ‚Äútechnology of recovery‚Äù (‚ÄúMaking a Case for the Black Digital Humanities, 2016), where an important goal is to make under-studied materials accessible and legible to a broad readership, including readers outside of academia. Other scholarship that has influenced our own includes the Colored Conventions Project (Foreman, Casey, and Patterson, 2021), and Roopika Risam‚Äôs New Digital Worlds(2018). And more generally, we see our work as continuing to fill in a continuing problem of the ‚ÄúArchive Gap,‚Äù where minoritized writers often continue to be under-studied and under-curated in major digital collections, with knock-on effects for quantitative analysis based on textual corpora (see Singh, ‚ÄúBeyond the Archive Gap,‚Äù 2020)."

    "text": "Why These Particular Periodicals? The Black Press and the Advent of ‚ÄúCrossover‚Äù Publications\nWe have attempted to build a comprehensive collection of African American periodical poetry from the early 20th century, arranging it so that visitors to this site can search and sort based on their own research questions. We believe that the creation of this collection will allow both serous scholars as well as students and those new to the field to see the full richness and range of African American poetry from this period in new ways.\nThe Black Press. First and foremost, we believe that in order to understand how African American poetry developed and grew in the years covered by this project, it‚Äôs important to engage with the primary venue through which that poetry was published and read ‚Äì the Black press. For many poets in this Anthology, African American-oriented periodicals were the first destination for poetry. Magazine publication was how Black poets found readers and developed a sense of community, and the collections we have produced for this project hopefully show some powerful emerging networks and conversations about the role of literature in civil rights activism, questions of aesthetics, and questions of language. Also, at least until the mid-1920s, publication in mainstream venues like Poetry or Vanity Fair was extremely rare for African American poets, so venues like The Crisis and Opportunity were often the best way to get published.\nTo be sure, the poetry published by these magazines is of quite varying quality and importance to literary historians. Rather than evaluate or curate the materials based on our particular tastes or preexisting consensus, our aspiration here is to make _all_of the periodical poetry we can find accessible to readers with the hope that it will be helpful to different kinds of research projects and questions. Putting everything together in one place, as we have attempted to do here, can sometimes reveal alignments and patterns that might not have previously been visible. What might readers discover? What new questions can we ask?\n1900-1920: A somewhat overlooked era in African American poetry. The field of African American periodical poetry was quite active in the first two decades of the 20th century, though many of the magazines where poetry was published were not well-preserved, and are today only available in fragments. Two important magazines from the first decade of the twentieth century that have been been well-preserved and digitized are Voice of the Negro (Atlanta and Chicago, 1904-1907) and Colored American Magazine (Boston and New York, 1900-1908). Both printed a considerable amount of poetry, and we have included a substantial number of poems from these magazines in our current collection (note: our collection of poetry from these two magazines is not quite complete). W.E.B. Du Bois also edited two magazines that appeared only briefly in this period, Moon Illustrated Weekly (1905-1906), and Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line (1907-1910). Horizon did not appear to print much in the way of poetry; Moon Illustrated Weekly printed poems only occasionally. Both magazines have only been partially preserved. At present, those magazines are sparsely represented in our collection.\nThe Crisis became a major vehicle for poetry publication starting in 1910, under Du Bois‚Äô editorship. It was an especially important venue for Georgia Douglas Johnson, who published more than 30 poems in the magazine during this period; we also see substantial numbers of poems published by writers like James D. Corrothers, Joseph S. Cotter, and Lucian B. Watkins ‚Äì writers who were well known at this time, but who subsequently dropped off the critical radar. Du Bois himself published several notable poems in The Crisis during this period, and these poems are included in our collection. One particularly active theme in late 1910s poetry is World War I (see the Glossary in a separate tab for other themes).\nThe 1920s: The Crisis, Opportunity, and The Messenger.  There were three very large and successful African American magazines in the 1920s, all published in New York but with national circulations: The Crisis, Opportunity, _and The Messenger. With The Crisis, there appears to have been a steady build-up of interest in poetry through the 1910s, leading up to Jessie Fauset‚Äôs taking on the role of literary editor between 1919-1926. With her work at The Crisis, Fauset brought a serious literary sensibility to the magazine and a considerable increase in quality.\nWith regards to Opportunity: as biographers for writers like Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes have documented, the racially-integrated Opportunity ‚Äúprize‚Äù dinners in 1924, 1925, and 1926 seemed to function at least in part as coming out parties for emerging writers, helping to create a sense of excitement about African American poetry both within the Black community and beyond it. White editors and publishers like Paul Kellogg and Horace Liveright attended a particularly important dinner at the Harlem Civic Club in March of 1924, which led to the idea of the special issue devoted to African American writing in Survey Graphic (March 1925), guest-edited by Alain Locke.\nThe mid-1920s as tipping point for African American poetry. As we‚Äôve developed our collection of African American periodical poetry, it‚Äôs become clearer and clearer that the mid- and late-1920s was a special moment of growth and recognition. First and foremost, there is the remarkable proliferation of African American general interest magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity, as mentioned above. The same period also saw the emergence of several African American literary magazines, including Fire!! in New York in 1926, Black Opals in Philadelphia in 1927-1928, and Saturday Evening Quill in Boston from 1928-1930. Fire!! ran for only a single issue; Black Opals ran for four issues, and featured many prominent names despite having a fairly tiny print run (250 copies of each issue were printed). Saturday Evening Quill, for its part, was essentially the house magazine for a vibrant African American literary social club active in the late 1920s in Boston. In the present collection, we have collected poems from each of these magazines.\nLast but not least, several mainstream publications open their pages to special issues devoted to African American poetry during this period. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the special March 1925 issue of Survey Graphic guest-edited by Alain Locke, which would become the basis for the hugely influential anthology The New Negro: an Interpretation (1925). There were also special issues dedicated to African American poetry published by modernist little magazines like Palms (guest-edited by Countee Cullen), as well as The Carolina Magazine, which did excellent issues on African American poetry, guest-edited by Lewis Alexander. This growing engagement from the mainstream was also reflected of course in the fact that mainstream commercial publishers in New York and Boston were also publishing significant quantities of African American poetry during this time period. Success in periodical publication often led to book-length poetry collections ‚Äì Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and James Weldon Johnosn all published book-length collections of poetry with mainstream New York publishers in the subsequent years. (Sadly, writers who were women did not appear to have this same benefit.)\nAlongside the Special Issues described above, Claude McKay published a number of poems, especially in Max Eastman-edited magazine, The Liberator (not to be confused with William Lloyd Garrison‚Äôs magazine of the same name from the mid-19th century). McKay is somewhat anomalous in that he published much more outside of the Black press than he did within it (though he is certainly well-represented in The Crisis)."

Who Collected It? \nThe texts that form the basis of the data in this dataset come from a variety of sources, including publicly available resources like _HathiTrust _and Archive.org. We also relied on the digitized versions of _Saturday Evening Quill _at the University of Delaware‚Äôs library. And a colleague at North Carolina State University, Madhusudan Kutti, was kind enough to send us a digitized copy of the 1926 special issue of Palms we have included in the collection; it was not available elsewhere. Our own work entailed reading the issues, locating poetry published in them, and creating text versions. We also made an effort to describe the poetic form, mark down thematic tags (‚ÄúProgress and Racial Uplift‚Äù; ‚ÄúMotherhood‚Äù; etc.). (See the Glossary of Themes and Forms Tab for more)\nThe lead researcher on this project is Amardeep Singh, a professor of English at Lehigh University. He has been creating digital projects related to minoritized writers for several years, beginning with projects like ‚ÄúClaude McKay‚Äôs Early Poetry‚Äù and ‚ÄúWomen of the Early Harlem Renaissance.‚Äù Since 2022, he has been developing a larger project called ‚ÄúAfrican American Poetry: A Digital Anthology‚Äù (AAPADA), a Scalar project that aims to be a comprehensive collection of poetry by Black writers that is out of copyright. The poems collected for this dataset are also presented in simple text versions on AAPADA.\nKate Hennessey, a Lehigh University graduate student, assisted with the collection of the data as well as the editing and formatting of poems during the spring of 2024. Other Lehigh graduate students have been involved with the project, either as paid graduate research assistants or as students in seminars, whose research and editing skills have at times been added to the project (with full credit and permission). Other recent students who have contributed to the project include Miranda Alvarez Guillen and Christian Farrior. Several of the students involved in the project are people who identify as Black."

    "text": "How might this dataset ‚Äì and the collection of texts behind it ‚Äì be used? \nThere are any number of ways this collection might be used.\nLiterary Prestige and Canonization. While some poets saw their careers and reputations take off during the peak years of the Harlem Renaissance, other writers were largely left by the wayside. By examining the ‚ÄúPrize-Winning‚Äù keyword under ‚ÄúThemes,‚Äù users can zoom in on poems and poets who dominated the literary prize contests at magazines like _Opportunity _and _The Crisis _starting in the mid-1920s. Another way of exploring the impact of individual poems might be to note poems that were republished in multiple venues (see the column ‚ÄúSecond Venue‚Äù in the dataset along those lines). The fact that a poem was repeatedly reprinted might be an indication of its literary cachet and social impact.\nGender. Another use might be to study changing gender distributions over the time period at issue. In the early years of the 20th century, poetry published in magazines like _Colored American Magazine _and Voice of the Negro was overwhelmingly dominated by poets who were men. By the 1920s, there was a significant uptick in poetry by women; how and where this was occurring could be studied in greater detail.\nAnother intriguing question is the role of editors who were women. Jessie Fauset played an important role at The Crisis through the 1910s through the mid-1920s; editors who were women also played important roles at Colored American Magazine (Pauline Hopkins), and Black Opals (Nellie Bright, Gwendolyn Bennett).\nAs of this writing, we are unaware of any African American poets from this period who identified as transgender or non-binary in our collection. If we come to learn more about authors‚Äô gender identity that might lead us to add additional gender identity categories, we will do that.\nPoetic Form. Scholars interested in the evolution of African American poetic forms in the early 20th century might want to explore our Poetic Form column. At the beginning of this period, most published poetry by Black poets was in rhymed, accented verse (often using the Common Measure); following the dominant trend in American poetry in the mid-1920s, there was an explosion of Free Verse in many of the magazines. The collection also contains a large number of African American Sonnets (written throughout the period), as well as experiments with the Blues, Elegies, and a number of other forms.\nThe Impact of Editors and Author-Editors. Editors played a huge role in encouraging African American poets in these various magazines. Some editors were also poets themselves. The poet Countee Cullen was on the masthead as an Associate Editor at Opportunity during the peak of his fame (1927-1928); he also guest-edited a special issue of the little magazine Palms in 1926, which probably informed his subsequent decision to edit the 1927 collection, Caroling Dusk. Jessie Fauset, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Lewis Alexander were all poets who also served as guest-editors or associate editors in various magazines during this period.\nPredominantly Black vs.¬†Predominantly White Publications. We have marked whether the magazines where poems where published were ‚Äúpredominantly White‚Äù or ‚Äúpredominantly Black.‚Äù In the 1920s in particular, there was a striking increase in the number of predominantly White publications that ran special issues devoted to African American poetry. Some of these were especially high-impact events (especially the special issue of Survey Graphic in March 1925). This too could be studied, especially in connection with other attributes (for instance, one sees that the Survey Graphic special issue mentioned above was especially influential; but the issue is far more lopsided towards poets who were men than one sees in predominantly Black publications from the same time period).\nWhite poets? As magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity became more prominent as national publications in the 1920s, they also had a substantial readership that was White. And with Countee Cullen playing a prominent role as an Associate Editor at Opportunity in 1927-1928, there were quite a few poets who were White publishing in these magazines. At present, we have excluded these writers from the collection. A future version of this project might include White poets who engaged with racial justice issues in the Black press (there were many who did, and their work has not been given much critical attention).\nFrequency of publication and authorial prestige. Poets like Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen published many poems in several different magazines during this period (both predominantly Black and predominantly White magazines). But poets who are less well-known today were also highly prolific ‚Äì one thinks especially of Georgia Douglas Johnson (who has approximately 50 poems represented in this dataset). However, some writers who published much less went on to have an outsized impact on the basis of relatively few poems ‚Äì one thinks of Helene Johnson, Mae V. Cowdery, and Arna Bontemps along those lines.\nExploring lesser-known authors. Many poems in the dataset were published by poets who did not aspire to have careers as poets; they may have only published one or two poems. Others (such as Edward S. Silvera and Lewis Alexander) were accomplished poets who were well-known to their peers, but might have dropped off abruptly (Edward Silvera died quite young, at age 31). And there are a few authors who published five or more poems included in this collection about whom we have been able to find nothing (one such name might be Ann Lawrence [also known as Ann Lawrence-Lucas]; she published several thoughtful poems in The Messenger in the mid-1920s)."

    "section": "Glossary: Topics, Themes, and Forms",
    "text": "Glossary: Topics, Themes, and Forms\nAs we‚Äôve been adding poetry to this collection, we‚Äôve been marking various thematic areas of interest. These tags can be a good way to explore our collection and see patterns and begin to emerge between and among authors featured on this site.\nHistorical Events and Tribute Poems\n\nWorld War I. This tag will be especially interesting to readers interested in African American writers responding to World War I, especially in the 1910s. Some writers took a critical eye to how Black soldiers were treated, and the difficulty of mustering patriotic feeling in a society that treated Black folks as second-class citizens. (14 poems with this tag)\nSpanish-American War. Poems dealing with African American soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war, including the Philippine War that followed (mainly 1900-1910).\n\nSlavery. Many of these writers were writing in living memory of the slavery era, and had relatives who had been enslaved. Paul Laurence Dunbar, for instance, was born to parents who had been enslaved. For Black writers in this period, grappling with the legacy of slavery was an important and ongoing topic. (33 poems with this tag)\nLynching and Racialized Violence. Thousands of African American people were brutally murdered in extrajudicial mob killings ‚Äì lynchings ‚Äì in this period. This was a topic that was widely covered in the Black press, especially in magazines like The Crisis. A few poems directly address this horrific phenomenon. Under this tag, we also include poems dealing with racialized violence (such as race riots) that might not strictly speaking be understood as lynchings. (21 poems with this tag)\nFrederick Douglass. Tribute poems for Frederick Douglass.\nPaul Laurence Dunbar. Tribute poems for Paul Laurence Dunbar.\nAbraham Lincoln. Poems by Black poets commemorating President Abraham Lincoln.\nCivil War. Poems by Black poets reflecting on the Civil War (1861-1865).\n\nSocial and Political Themes\n\nRace. Many, many poems in this collection might be tagged as dealing with race in some way, so over time we have added additional differentiations for two especially important subtopics: ‚ÄúRace: Identity formation‚Äù and ‚ÄúRace: Black Beauty.‚Äù (100+ poems with some version of this tag)\nRacism. Poems tagged with ‚Äúracism‚Äù deal explicitly with racialized hostility, segregation, and its effects on the African American community.\nProgress and Racial Uplift. Poems thematizing racial progress, uplift, and the civil rights movement. (Approximately 44 poems in the collection are tagged this way)\nQueer and Homoerotic. Poems dealing with same-sex desire or LGBTQIA identities. Several important writers from this period are known from biographical evidence to have been LGBTQIA; here we have tagged only poems that seem to explicitly reflect same-sex or queer desire.\nMotherhood. This is a rich topic, especially for poets from the 1910s. Some of the most memorable poetry thematizing motherhood is written by Georgia Douglas Johnson. (18 poems with this tag)\nInterracial, Multiracial, and Race Relations. Poems dealing with relationships that cross racial borders, including friendships, antagonistic relationships, and romances. We also use this category for poems that reference mixed-race people, such as Georgia Douglas Johnson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Octoroon.‚Äù (21 poems with this tag)\nReligion. Poems representing engagement with religion, including both the affirmative embrace of Christianity in the interest of civil rights and more critical engagements.\nLabor. Poems dealing with class and labor relations. (approx. 30 poems with this tag)\nTravel, Migration and Great Migration. This was a period in which many African American writers were on the move, and this tag references poems that deal with travel in Europe or Africa. It is also used for poems dealing with the Great Migration, the massive movement of Black folks from the U.S. south to northern amd midwestern cities that began in the early 1900s and continued through the 1940s. (approx. 28 poems with this tag)\nPatriotism. Poems exploring the often conflicted relationship many African American writers had with questions of patriotism and national pride.\n\nPlaces / Regions / Institutions\n\nHarlem. As is well-known, Harlem was the epicenter of the Black cultural community that emerged in the 1920s, and many poets celebrated it in their writing, including Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and many others.\nHBCU. Many Black writers from this period were associated with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in some way. Some ‚Äì notably Langston Hughes ‚Äì attended HBCUs and received degrees there. Others, including Alain Locke, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charles Johnson, and Zora Neale Hurston, taught at HBCUs. There are many references to universities like Fisk University, Howard University, Atlanta University, and so on in the poetry of this period.\nAfrica. Poems that thematize Africa in some way. Imagining Africa was an important theme for many Black poets in the early 20th century ‚Äì both those involved with the UNIA and Garveyism and more broadly. Africa was especially vivid to Langston Hughes, as he had a memorable visit to West Africa early in his career.\n\nCaribbean. Writers like Claude McKay and Eric Walrond had direct Caribbean connections, and often wrote about it in their works. But others ‚Äì especially Langston Hughes ‚Äì also engaged the Caribbean in their writing. The Caribbean was also important to Arthur Schomburg, who immigrated to the U.S. from Puerto Rico in 1891.\n\nOther Themes and Forms\n\nSonnet. Poems using the sonnet form. The sonnet form was highly prevalent in African American poetry during this period. Claude McKay famously used sonnets in many of his most influential political poems. Writers like Georgia Douglas Johnson and Carrie Williams Clifford also found the sonnet form appealing, again, in connection with social justice-oriented poetry. (approx. 75 poems with this tag)\nVarious other poetic forms: Common Measure, Villanelle, Terza Rima, Elegy, Ode, Haiku, Ballad, Free Verse, Blues\nPrize-winning poems. Poems that won one of the poetry prize competitions from the mid-1920s, sponsored by either The Crisis or Opportunity magazine. (32 poems with this tag)\nMusic. The emphasis on music in poems by Langston Hughes is well-known, but in fact many Black poets from this period were interested in the connections between music and lyricism.\nIntertextual. Poems that allude to other authors, including white authors.\nBlack Vernacular (AAVE). Poems using AAVE. There were active debates at the time among Black poets about the use of language that was sometimes seen as caricaturing Black voices.\nPoetry for children. Many well-known African American writers of this period wrote poems for children on occasion, including especially Langston Hughes and Jessie Fauset."

    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\nThe very first National Park ‚Äî¬†Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming ‚Äî¬†was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. A handful of other parks ‚Äî¬†Sequoia, Yosemite, Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake¬†‚Äî joined the system in the next several decades. While the National Parks were originally created to protect precious, beautiful lands and to make them accessible to the public ‚Äî a noble goal ‚Äî it‚Äôs important to remember that these lands were taken, often forcibly, from Native American people who already owned, lived, and worked on them (Beauchamp 2020). Today, there are still calls for the NPS to return the lands of the National Parks to Indigenous people.\nScholars have similarly shown that early conservation movements, which spurred the development of the National Parks, were troublingly intertwined with racism and eugenics movements (Beauchamp 2020). These prejudiced origins, combined with continuing forms of environmental racism, have contributed to the marginalization of people of color and other minorities in the parks ‚Äî in other words, research has shown that white people visit the parks much more than other demographic groups(Weber and Sultana 2013; Alba et al. 2022; Floyd and Johnson 2002). The National Parks are not equally accessible to everyone in the same way, and these exclusions shape the park visitation data even before it‚Äôs counted.\nVisit counting, according to the NPS, started a long time ago ‚Äî as early as 1904 (more than 10 years before the National Park Service itself was officially created). However, at this time, their data collection methods were mostly ‚Äúinformal,‚Äù inconsistent, and low-tech. But over the next century, the NPS worked hard to make their methods more reliable, consistent, and (in some but not all cases) technologically advanced.\nA big catalyst for the NPS getting serious about data collection was a new law. In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources (i.e.¬†to buying up more land and water so that condo developers couldn‚Äôt do it first) and to expanding outdoor recreation infrastructure in the U.S.\nBecause this act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each area should be ‚Äúproportional to visitor use,‚Äù the NPS buckled down on counting visitor use. Over the next twenty years, they accordingly ‚Äúdeveloped and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.‚Äù\nWhile today‚Äôs National Park data collection system is more formal and sophisticated than the one that the NPS used in 1904, there are still many inconsistencies, flaws, and limitations in this system. And these shortcomings are largely unavoidable. Trying to record every single visit to a National Park ‚Äî across dozens of different parks and geographic regions; many decades of time; countless changing weather conditions; a great deal of economic and financial fluctuation; and hundreds of millions of people ‚Äî is pretty much impossible. We believe this data is useful to study, in fact, because it helps demonstrate that data never reflects reality precisely.\nHowever, the National Park visit data also demonstrates why collecting and analyzing data, even if it is flawed and approximate, is sometimes worthwhile ‚Äî if you fully understand the data‚Äôs flaws, limitations, and history, and if you incorporate these considerations into all subsequent analyses, interpretations, and takeaways."

Who collected it?\nThe National Park data on this website was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, a specific program tasked with coordinating visitor statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members across all 63 parks were also involved in the data collection process.\nThe original data was made available through the NPS‚Äôs Visitor Use Statistics data portal. Through this portal, you can generate reports and download data for many different park visitation categories and time periods¬†‚Äî¬†at both national and individual park levels. To download the data included here, we first selected ‚ÄúNational Reports‚Äù in the data portal, and we then selected the ‚ÄúQuery Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)‚Äù report type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Selections for National Park visit data generated with ‚ÄúQuery Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)‚Äù\n\n\n\nFor ‚ÄúPark Types,‚Äù we selected only ‚ÄúNational Parks‚Äù; for ‚ÄúYears,‚Äù we selected all possible years (1979-2023); for ‚ÄúRegions,‚Äù we selected all possible regions; for ‚ÄúField Type,‚Äù we selected only ‚ÄúRecreation Visits‚Äù (excluding ‚ÄúNonRecreation Visits,‚Äù‚Äù ‚ÄúRecreation Hours,‚Äù ‚ÄúNonRecreation Hours,‚Äù ‚ÄúConcessioner Lodging,‚Äù ‚ÄúConcessioner Camping,‚Äù ‚ÄúTent Campers,‚Äù ‚ÄúRV Campers,‚Äù ‚ÄúBackcountry Campers,‚Äù ‚ÄúNonRecreation Overnight Stays,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMiscellaneous Overnight Stays‚Äù); for ‚ÄúAdditional Fields,‚Äù we selected ‚ÄúState‚Äù and ‚ÄúRegion‚Äù. We also selected the option of viewing the report as an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts).\nIf you choose to download this report as a CSV file, it will unfortunately not look exactly like the report pictured in Figure¬†1; instead, the CSV will include all visit and use types, and it will include visit/use information by month rather than aggregated by year. When I have compiled this data to share with my students in the past, I have sometimes downloaded the CSV file and then removed the columns that I‚Äôm not interested in and aggregated the data by year programatically. In other cases, I have simply copied and pasted the annual summary report into a CSV file.\nIn either case, it is usually necessary to explicitly transform the format of the ‚ÄúRecreationVisits‚Äù column into a number and to remove the commas that separate the numbers by thousands (a transformation that you can do with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets or with a programming language) Finally, we published the data to this project‚Äôs GitHub repository for easier storage and access."

But the NPS also uses the visit data for other internal purposes ‚Äî¬†to determine which parks need more staff members and programming, which hiking trails need more maintenance, or which visitor centers need more bathrooms.\nThe visit data also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best provide and share resources, like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. If millions more hikers started to come to Mt. Rainier, for example, that would be a very important thing for the surrounding community to know. To consider just one consequence of this increase, those hikers would likely need more ambulance trips and rescue helicopters, and you wouldn‚Äôt want visitors to the local National Park booking up all the emergency vehicles in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: 2021 report on NPS economic impact // Graphic by NPS\n\n\n\nThe visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact‚Äîeconomic and otherwise‚Äîthat the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large (Figure¬†2). These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, and attention.\nThe data is also frequently reported on by journalists, who use it to highlight the most popular parks and noteworthy visitation records, as well as to point their readers to parks where they might be able to find some peace and quiet (see articles in Thrillist, Smithsonian, and CNN)."

For example, some people need to travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through the park, or because they live on ‚Äúinholdings‚Äù (private property that is surrounded by a National Park on all sides). Other people are visiting the parks because they have actual business to conduct in the parks.\nHere‚Äôs a full list of ‚Äúreportable non-recreation‚Äù visitsaccording to the NPS:\n\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g.¬†meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that ‚Äúrecreation visit‚Äù counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we‚Äôll discuss more below).\nIt also means that they‚Äôre not counting individual people. This data doesn‚Äôt tell us anything about the people who are visiting.\n(Note: The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota is located inside Badlands National Park (the visitor center is on the reservation), which could be worth discussing here.)"

    "text": "How was the data collected?\nSo how does the NPS actually count these recreation visits? Take a moment and see if you come up with a few guesses‚Ä¶\nIt turns out that each park counts visits differently. And at many parks, each entrance at each park even counts visits differently.\nIf you go to the ‚ÄúPark Reports‚Äù tab in the NPS Data Portal, you can look up an individual park and download a PDF file called ‚ÄúVisitor Use Counting Procedures,‚Äù which details exactly what procedures they use to count visits at this park. Most of the parks have several PDFs because their counting procedures have changed many times over the years!\nTo count visits, most parks use a combination of automatic traffic counters and manual counting‚Äîthat is, staff members who use their eyeballs to literally count the number of people arriving by foot, bike, bus, cross-country skis, snowmobile, boat, canoe, etc. Perhaps most interesting, they usually take those counts and then apply a specifically designed mathematical formula to arrive at the most accurate estimate of number of recreation visits ‚Äî adding, subtracting, and multiplying the counts based on a variety of factors, such as the season or the entrance (e.g.¬†assuming that more people would likely be arriving in a car in the summer months at the most popular gate than in the winter months at the least popular gate) or how many non-recreation visits they expect are a confounding factor.\nThis browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: &lt;a href=\"other_docs/Everglades_Visitor-Use-Counting-Procedures_2023.pdf\"&gt;Download PDF&lt;/a&gt;\nFor example, at Everglades National Park, at the Shark Valley Entrance, there is a pneumatic tube traffic counter that counts the number of cars that pass over it. The staff members then apply different mathematical operations to this number in order to arrive at what they think is the most accurate estimate of recreation visits:\n\nThe traffic count is divided by 2 to account for entry and exit. The adjusted traffic count is reduced by the number of buses, the number of bicycles counted when the entrance station is open, 127 bicycles per month to account for after-hours use, and by 200 non-recreation vehicles per month October through May and 100 non-recreation vehicles per month June through September. The traffic count is further reduced by 350 non-reportable (NPS) vehicles per month. The reduced count is multiplied by 2.17 persons per vehicle.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, the devices that the NPS uses to count visits, like pneumatic tube counters or induction loop counters (magnetised coils of wire that are installed under a road, and that ‚Äútrip‚Äù when a vehicle passes over them) sometimes break.\n\n\n\nAn example of a pneumatic tube traffic counter, installed above the road\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop, installed beneath a road (making it harder to detect when it breaks!)\n\n\nFor example, according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances at Crater Lakes National Park broke in 2012 and wasn‚Äôt repaired for at least a year:\n\n2/1/2012 | The Traffic Counter at Annie Springs Entrance Station was not functioning properly and therefore we have a count of zero.\n\n\n3/1/2012 | Broken counter at Annie Springs Entrance, unable to record numbers.\n\n\n4/1/2012 | Traffic counter was broken for the beginning of the month and may have low numbers.\n\n\n10/1/2012 | Counts estimated by Butch\n\n\n11/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n12/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n1/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\n\n2/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\nYou can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears that visits have been declining since around 2019:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decline may, in part, be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut the NPS logs also show that the main induction loop counter at Carlsbad Caverns broke in 2019 and has remained broken for multiple years:\n\n9/1/2019 | Traffic counter apparently has been broken since July. Traffic counts are estimated.\n\n\n4/1/2020 | Main road traffic counter is broken, I have estimated the count.\n\n\n12/1/2020 | Corona virus closure that began in November ended on December 4th. Main road traffic counter remains broken.Possible problem with Loop Road counter.\n\n\n4/1/2022 Main road traffic counter remains broken. Rattlesnake Springs traffic counter seems to be off, I will henceforth provide estimates.\n\n\n9/1/2023 | Loop Road and backcountry closed due to flood damage. Slaughter Canyon Cave remains closed Traffic counter on main road remains broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1\n\n\n\nNow that we‚Äôve talked about how data is collected (and the fragility of some of those methods), it‚Äôs a good time to think about how even the same method, deployed at different places, might be differently unreliable. For more, see Activity 1."

This hard number makes it seem conclusive, like there really were zero people people who stepped onto the park lands in those years.\nIn 2015, John Quinley, the Alaska regional spokesperson for the NPS, spoke with the Anchorage Daily News about this issue, and he admitted that ‚Äúit might have been better if park statisticians had put something other than a zero in the visitor box for 2014 ‚Äî say maybe a question mark.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nWhy would you or wouldn‚Äôt you want to record a question mark in this dataset? What else could you use to record uncertainty?\n\n\nThe decision not to record visits in certain years seems reasonable on its face, but we‚Äôve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that, when faced with a similar situation, chose to provide an estimate for a certain year based on average counts from previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited. This matters because, as we‚Äôve discussed, there are financial, political, and social ramifications of these visit count numbers."

But they will also get fixed at different rates, in different locations, as we could see in the case of Crater Lake National Park (where a counter was fixed quickly) and Carlsbad Caverns National Park (where a broken counter from 2019 still has not been fixed).\nThere are many reasons for these disparities, but some of the big ones might be geography and resources. The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP"
