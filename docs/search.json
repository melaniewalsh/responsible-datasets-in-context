    "text": "Mission\nData cannot be analyzed responsibly without deep knowledge of its social and historical context, provenance, and limitations. Anyone who works with data — from academic researchers to industry professionals — will know this claim to be true.\nHere’s the problem. Though we can all agree that understanding the social and historical context of data is one of the most essential skills for responsible designers, engineers, and technologists, it is one of the most neglected skills in undergraduate computing education.\nWhen students are asked to find their own datasets in classes, they often go to websites like Kaggle and end up downloading and working with data that they don’t fully understand — a recipe for irresponsible data work, a bad habit that can become a dangerous habit as the stakes get higher.\nWe believe there are two main reasons for this neglect:\n\nSTEM education has not, broadly speaking, invested in the kinds of critical cultural and historicist approaches that have characterized humanities education.\nMeaningful datasets that are both richly documented and well-suited for undergraduate computing education are difficult to find and very time-consuming to produce.\n\n“Responsible Datasets in Context: Collaboratively Designing for Ethical Humanities Data Education” seeks to strengthen students’ capacity to work with data responsibly by addressing both of these issues. On this website, we provide curated datasets that are carefully documented and paired with long-form essays, which both explore and interrogate each dataset’s construction, history, quirks, flaws, and strengths from different humanistic perspectives.\nWe also provide lesson plans, programming exercises, discussion questions, and activities that can help instructors integrate the datasets into their teaching. Beyond our specific educational goals, we also hope these datasets, essays, and accompanying materials will be useful and informative for the broader public.\nBased on our work and conversations, we also offer the following principles to help guide ethically responsible dataset curation, consumption, and analysis:\n–Tell the Data’s Story / Know the Data’s Story. As scholars like Johanna Drucker and others have been arguing for more than a decade, data is not simply objectively “there” in the world. Datasets have human-oriented stories behind them and implicit within them, and insofar as we are invested in curating helpful datasets for scholars and students to use, the stories of how and why data was created ought to be integrally connected to the datasets themselves. What are the constraints of the source material? What material might be simply absent from the historical record, and how do those absences shape what data we can effectively construct? Also, where are there elements of uncertainty or fuzziness in the data? If choices had to be made regarding, for instance, the dating of a creative work, how were those choices made, and why?\n–Provide and Describe Metadata / Understand Metadata. Metadata is often overlooked. But understanding what each datapoint and feature represents is fundamental to ethically responsible data work, so it is important to gives users a way to access and understand that metadata. Which categories were deemed important to catalog and measure, and which were excluded? If gender is an aspect of metadata, is gender only available under binarized categories? Is race included or discussed – and why?\n–Touch Every Spreadsheet Cell. For creators and users of datasets, it is important to actually explore and try out datasets to make sure they’re accurate and glitch-free, and that they represent what we think they represent — in other words, it is important to actually open a dataset in Excel, Google Sheets, etc., and touch/examine individual cells. When data is too large for these kinds of applications, it is important to examine individual data points in other ways. This is a basic yet surprisingly radical concept! And it is especially important when we use automated processes to create datasets, like web scraping, which are also more likely to distance us from individual data points.\n– Consider When Data Should Remain Off-Limits or Private. There is a growing movement in data science to think carefully about who can ethically access certain kinds of data. Representations of tribal rituals among indigenous communities is often only meant for members of those communities, so accessing photographs or other sorts of quantitative data about that traditional knowledge should probably be restricted. Projects like Mukurtu have specifically addressed this issue and developed platforms where communities can choose who they share their data with.\nSimilarly, the editors of sites like the Colored Conventions Project have argued that data about enslaved people and their descendents has historically “served in the processes and recording of the destruction and devaluation of Black lives and communities.” They main that there is an urgent need to affirm “the Black humanity inherent in Black data/curation.” In other words, insofar as data is about real people who may have been marginalized or oppressed, it is important that those people be named and recognized."

    "section": "THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT",
    "text": "THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT\nSections in the following section comes from Fernández Quintanilla & Bejarano’s “Fuerza Feminista: Confronting Intersectional Data Violence by Archiving the Movement against Anti-Feminicides in the Paso del Norte Region” (forthcoming 2025) and Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano’s “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities” (forthcoming 2025).\nThe specific topic the “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” course focused on gender violence and the feminicidios in the transborder region of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, El Paso, Texas, and Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The course first focused on a localized perspective in this transborder region before shifting to a broader U.S. and global perspective.\nFor over thirty years, the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua bordering Texas and New Mexico have experienced and witnessed multiple forms of violence across its rural and urban regions. Communities are besieged with cartels and gender-based violence, and the saturation of international corporations that pay workers less than livable wages for workers in Ciudad Juárez. An overwhelming amount of attention has focused on Ciudad Juárez for cases of feminicide pointing to the early 1990s as a period when families of disappeared and murdered women, activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and national and international human rights regimes clamored over the hundreds of women and girls who disappeared and were never found, or whose remains were located near or within Ciudad Juárez (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Lagarde y de los Ríos, 2010; Driver, 2015; Lozano, 2019). Concentrated attention was given to the feminicides at that time, but over the years, less focus has been given to the galvanizing efforts of local people to demand responses from authorities to resolve these atrocities. (From Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\nDespite the increased social awareness, local community activism, formation of local organizations and nonprofits, and foreign academic interventions—there is still no satisfactory response from Mexican authorities regarding Mexican feminicidios. Among the notable and progressive changes that have occurred to bring justice to the murdered women and girls is the legal classification of feminicide, or feminicidio, as Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos coined and inserted into Mexican legal framework, which she co-proposed and co-created (Monárrez Fregoso, Rosa-Linda, and Bejarano 2020). The term femicide emerged from Diana Russell and Jill Radford’s Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing (1992), which proposed a feminist approach in addressing the disproportionate killing of women by differentiating these murders from general homicides. Although the direct translation of femicide to Spanish is femicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos argued that it was not enough to classify these murders as separate from homicide; thus, she coined feminicidio. By naming feminicide, feminicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos expanded on the definition of femicide to “name the ensemble of violations of women’s human rights, which contain the crimes against and the disappearances of women” (2020). The term feminicidio acknowledges that the killing of women is an institutional and systemic violence, meaning that feminicidios occur because of the authorities’ omission, negligence, and/or collusion with the assailants which inhibits women’s access to justice and thereby contributes to impunity.\nYet, even with the legal designation of feminicidios as a form of institutional gender violence, there is much work to be done. Many well-meaning (and sometimes, not so well-meaning) works of art, novels, and films have inadvertently contributed to sensationalizing Ciudad Juárez’s feminicides (Driver 2015). Rather than garnering awareness as intended, some of these media formats have fallen into entertainment categories, further dehumanizing these women and girls’ deaths. With this precedent, it is essential to mention that local community members, such as the victims’ mothers, family members, academics, journalists, and many others in the region and in different parts of the world have been actively archiving and collecting data regarding the feminicides. (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)\nPeople in Chihuahua and the greater border region have engaged in transnational movements to stop gender-based violence by implementing diverse data and record-keeping processes to hold state systems accountable. Everyday people played an active role in pursuing justice in response to backlogged and slow-moving justice systems and negligent authorities working within crumbling infrastructures, which caused other forms of violence against feminicide victims’ families when state systems blamed, ignored, or outright rejected families’ demands to solve these crimes. Families, activists, and human rights defenders were confronted by misogynistic and hyper-patriarchal practices by authorities who perpetuated these ideologies, thus, working ineffectively to end feminicides. Some were inept or even fearful of resolving these crimes, subsequently, exhibiting a dereliction of duty by failing to keep accurate data-keeping files (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Driver, 2015; Bejarano, 2023).\nFeminist activists, digital activists, activist-scholars, and everyday people world-wide are vigorously working to engage in data-keeping mobilizations to document and protest feminicides and gender-based violence. These data-keeping resistance movements collect data to contest the intersectional violence that authorities create and foment. Feminist data projects galvanize record-keeping efforts to maintain and even recover data and make visible the extent of gender-based violence in communities across the Global South and Global North. There are several prominent feminist data projects documenting gender-based violence in existence across the Americas. These projects primarily focus on data that is counting feminicides from specific BIPOC women’s groups or regions, and visualizing these crimes through spreadsheets, repositories, and other forms of digital visualizations such as maps and infographics. Collectively, the data from these projects have served the anti-feminicide movement as tools to counter the erasure or minimization of feminicides that authorities will often claim. Of these nine data projects listed below, we will discuss the first three listed in detail, as they are digital public-facing projects that focus on cases of gender-violence and feminicide in Cd. Juarez. Digital projects like Ellas Tienen Nombre and Ecos del Desierto and archival collections like the Ester Cano Chavez Collection are powerful examples of how civil society organizations, everyday people, and families take the responsibility of collecting this feminist data and doing the work of the authorities. They provide transparency and an unofficial record of data with the use of digital technologies and collaborative practices with professionals in libraries and archival studies, visual studies, geographical information systems, web developers, and other allies. Thus, these types of resources provide a digital record with critical data that impacts the lives of many families and serves as a tool to seek justice. (From Fernandez Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\nActivism, whether it stems from academic institutions, art forms, or through other representations, need to be done ethically, especially since feminicides are a global systemic occurrence and not only occur in the U.S./Mexico border cities. Through the “Border Women” course projects, students approached digital tools, data, and the course’s sensitive topics with the intention of not replicating the same colonial research practices referenced and studied as a class as well as using a humanities-based approach to gender violence data. Since some forms of feminicide awareness decenter the focus of gender violence away from the women and girls themselves, it is necessary that students not only read about and discuss the ethics of gender violence data, but also apply these methodologies and confront these ethical questions through creating their own digital projects."

    "text": "COURSE INTRODUCTION\nIn Fall 2023 with the support of the “Responsible Computing Challenge” of the Mozilla Foundation, with the Responsible Datasets in Context Project, the undergraduate course “Border Women Literature and Feminist Cartography” to be revised and be offered to students from Data Science, History, English, Political Science, Spanish and Film and Media Studies from the Honor’s College and the College of Liberal and Fine Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\nThe course was offered as a special topic, interdisciplinary, collaborative and experiment-driven, where students explore and critically analyze a selected group of border women’s literary texts, archival material, oral histories, digital projects with datasets and databases of counterdata (D’Ignazio 2024) that addressed gender-based and related violence and feminicides at the US-Mexico border and other parts of the world. Through a close and distant reading analysis students enhance in the development of multilingual humanities datasets to explore a series of thematical feminist cartographies through transnational, intersectional, antiracist, geographical and historical frameworks. Additionally, students explore various methods and digital tools and software with public datasets to convert these excerpts into a series of informative critical data visualizations.\nThroughout the course, relevant social, historical, cultural readings, digital material, visual aids, interviews and workshops with writers, critics, activists, project creators and data specialists were included to help students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Overall, students engage in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing at the intersection of feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping and data science.\n Image 1.

    "section": "COURSE DATASET FINAL PROJECT",
    "text": "COURSE DATASET FINAL PROJECT\nIn the Final Module—&gt;Atando cabos, students were divided into six teams and were assigned to create a responsible dataset in context under a particular theme discussed in this course. Every team was tasked with a different form of approaching data, thus deciding on a methodology that will work best under the scenario they faced. Throughout this process they encountered several challenges that exposed them work with missing, uncontextualized, wrong data, data in other languages than English, the digital divide, the pre-digital age, lack of information in the digital cultural record, and the need to do field work or work closely with individuals, community members or organizations involved. Additionally, they had great observations of future work that can be done with these datasets or to make this data more accessible in other platforms to better serve those who are advocating for justice in the public and political level, as well as to expand the research on this data of counting feminicides and human rights movements.\n\nDataset #1: Tracing Feminicides in El Paso, Texas Using the Hispanic-American Newspaper Newsbank-Readex Collection\n\nTeam: Jessica Corona (Leader), Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, & Sara Mosher\nProject Link\nDataset description: Since the beginning of society in the United States, stereotypes and representations of women have been created to oppress them. Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n\nDataset #2: Digital and Translated Version of “El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio” Printed Spreadsheet\n\nTeam: Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille\nProject Link\nDataset Description: As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset.\nDataset dissemination: visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n\nDataset #3: Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).\n\nTeam: Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, Kiri Avelar, & Paris Cantu\nProject Link\nDataset Description: The project’s purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were Woman Hollering Creek (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories (1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from Woman Hollering Creek and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in The Mystery of Survival. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters’ experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n\nDataset #4: Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World\n\nTeam: Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla, Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill\nProject Link\nDataset Description: In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected. Though we are still predominantly shining our light on women and gender-based violence, we found other marginalized communities that can have their messages shared. Films like Killers of the Flower Moon showcase violence based on the Osage community and other similar native American communities, and Milk which shows an openly gay politician fighting to break out of the glass ceiling. These films, though show\ndifferent variations and levels of violence, intersectionality of present, it shows the trials these marginalized communities have faced. While engaged in the data collection and analysis we wanted to highlight these stories as well as leave it strictly to gender-based violence toward women. At the end, the dataset evolved and can be defined into four main takeaways/themes: personification of violence, definitions of violence, representation of genre, and missing stories. The first takeaway was the personification of violence; breaking this down into the on-screen, almost jarring reality of the possible glorification, stylization, and informative analysis of violence on screen. Our team felt that many of the films listed on the dataset could be argued and grouped into any one of the said narratives. This allows the audience to further their own definitions of gender violence in film. This does lead to the next takeaway, definitions. Throughout the construction of the dataset, we noticed a common theme with films depicting gender violence and/or having a main plot point be that of gendered violence. Many of the films listed are defined and categorized as “romances”. Films like Urban Cowboy, I, Tonya, and Lolita are all defined as romances; all these films depict graphic scenes of abuse, both physical and mental. Our question as a group is how does depicting and defining this film impact viewers? Are they glorifying? Are they stylizing? Are they informing? Our third takeaway was the cross-representation of genre. The dataset is broad - it includes films, biopics, documentaries, docuseries, horror, historical dramas, science fiction, and many more. We discovered that genre can be a visual but also narrative aid and representation with overall thematic analysis in relation to a film. Many of the films that we listed focused on and outlined meaningful, non-voyeuristic representational work on the issue of violence against women. All the films, across genres, in most ways, were symbolic of violating the heteronormative values of women and other marginalized groups in media; all following the steppingstones of action, resistance, and retribution. The last takeaway was the missing stories that we, as a group, found that were absent after completing the dataset. Again, it is a broad dataset, but there are still not enough individual, personal stories being represented. Many of our films fall under two categories: white, cis-female representation and wide-releases in English-speaking countries. There is a gap in our data that we must be aware of for the future of the dataset. The stories these films captured span from 1918 to the present, but there are still missing stories, missing people who need to be heard through the media of film.\nDataset dissemination: app, visualizations, image analysis, digital repository and digital exhibit\n\nDataset #5: Books and Articles from Mexico and the U.S. Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Jared Pond (Leader), Emily Malloy (Leader), Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, & Ambonnay Rodriguez\nProject Link\nDataset Description: This dataset project was to call attention to feminicide and gender violence in scholarly literature. We wanted to show that these women are remembered and were failed by their society and protectors. To make people uncomfortable enough to understand the seriousness of this topic, and to show that there are people keeping track and those who care. Our dataset tracks information on pieces of scholarly literature primarily from the U.S. and Mexico that relate to femicide and gender violence. This dataset can be used to compare the types of literature and how it is represented across different publishing houses and countries. And the noticeable absence of information from publishing houses in Mexico. Some of our findings include the trait of Chicano, Hispanic, and Mexican authors publishing in areas other than Mexico, leading to the question of how much, and how hard the government and society itself tries to hide this violence. For example, some of the first books touching on these topics like El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra or Cosecha de Mujeres had trouble finding a publisher and had even issues with some editors in charge. Our limitations included: authors not being on the internet, authors being hidden by other authors’ articles by other interpretations, and not being able to fully investigate and read every single piece of literature we listed. We also understand that we did not incorporate as many essays, articles, and books as there are in other databases as well. The next step for this project is to keep expanding on these works in any way possible. Those who work on this dataset may be able to make more connections between the data than we were able to see as their background knowledge is different than ours; or maybe even more resources than we do. We also recognize that we are missing data and possibly have inaccuracies, but it’s clear that femicide has become more apparent globally and is something that nobody should be quiet about.\n\nDataset #6: Murals and Public Monuments Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Nilou Esmaeili (Leader), Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson\nProject Link\nDataset Description: For this final dataset project, as a group we scavenged data pertaining to murals and monuments placed throughout Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, other various cities throughout Mexico, and internationally. The purpose of this dataset is to hopefully bring awareness to how frequently gender-based violence occurs especially in hotspots such as areas around the US-Mexican border, throughout Mexican cities, other countries of more conservative nature, more populated countries, etc… The list can go on, but the point is, that gender-based violence happens worldwide every day whether we witness it or not. Most of the data sources were from social media sites such as Instagram and X (Twitter). We encountered that when scrolling through these applications, there are a lot of bots, inappropriate content, threats, and unrelated posts. It was frustrating because social media is a good source to pull current information and data from, but navigating was annoying. Originally, our purpose would’ve been to create a program (code) to help the team members easily navigate and pick out the data needed throughout the loads of data and posts we go through on articles and social media sites. Unfortunately, it requires more advanced coding skills to create this program because it utilizes AI databases and even creating databases for the AI coding working with this data requires field work to process this data. Student comment: “I encounter having to interact with data in a way I have not even begun learning nor brushed up on in any of my classes. For reasons such as that, I scrapped my program completely and just manually mined data for our project. It would’ve been a nice way to make it easier for not only me and my groupmates, but my other classmates to use.”\nDataset dissemination: mapping, image analysis, digital and 3D exhibits, virtual reality"

This text was published by Ediciones del Azar A.C. in November of 1999, with 1001 issues distributed and no edited version created after.

WHO COLLECTED IT?\n\nDataset Translation & Digitization\nA group of undergraduate students at the University of Texas at San Antonio digitized and translated the original feminicide dataset provided by El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra as part of Honor’s course, “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” (Fall 2023) taught by Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla and Paulina Hernández-Trejo. This group of undergraduate students were Jasbeth Medrano (Political Science), Carolina Vlaun (English), Judith Ordonez (Film and Media), Alex Sanchez (Computer Science), and Samuel Friedrich (Kinesiology).\n\n\nOriginal Dataset Authors\nThe data came from a dataset that was included at the end of the book, El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra, by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz, who worked together to collect the data and created the dataset and map previously shown in Image 9 and 10. The authors of El Silencio compiled this dataset and published it in 1999. Besides the dataset, El Silencio intentionally humanizes some of the women and girls that are in the dataset through testimonios of their mothers and family members. According to its introduction chapter, El Silencio’s larger objective would not just be the contribution of this ample feminicide dataset, but rather an intimate encounter between the testimonies of the victims’ mothers and the data itself. El Silencio’s authors wanted this encounter to show how these feminicidios imply a larger systemic violence against women, one that we are all accountable for creating in the way we control women.\nThis text does not feature any of the perpetrators or suspects, aligning with its objective of highlighting the lives, not the deaths, of these women and girls. Thus, El Silencio highlights the lives of Erendira, Sagrario, Olga Alicia, Elizabeth, Adriana, Silvia Elena, and Argelia in detail in between the chapters discussing the creation of the dataset. As the authors reiterate, Ciudad Juárez “should be remembered not only for its feminicides, but also for its women who live a common life, perhaps like our own, one like your mother, your sister or your daughter….the victims should never be considered ‘the problem’ or stigmatized for their deaths; the silence, self-censorship, complicity, and negligence are what should outrage and shame us” (6)."

    "text": "WHY WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? HOW IS THE DATA USED?\nOriginally the data was collected under the lack of response from the Mexican authorities, the United States government to take seriously the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua and its surroundings since the early 1900s. Under this situation, the mothers, family members, activists, human rights defender and others have worked individually and collectively to learn best ways to gather information to fight for justice, policy changes and to work on the different cases that have not been solved. In this case, the original spreadsheet of El Silencio was created by the authors of this book, as they were writers and journalists working for local newspapers (_El Diario _and El Norte) in Cd. Juarez where they started to get together to collect the data of missing and murdered cases since 1990 through newspapers reports, government reports and then corroborating with some of the mothers and family members through their testimonios. This spreadsheet was one of the first ones that accounts to the feminicides in Cd. Juarez and its surroundings in the early 90s when these cases started to have national and international attention. This data has been used for legal cases and for further investigation of the cases documented, as well as for other activists and scholars to continue advocating from justice in physical and digital spaces through initiatives that keep track of this counterdata of feminicides (D’Ignazio, 2024). Some examples are:\n\nAccountant and founder of Casa Amiga, Esther Chavez Cano, who collected all the newspapers and documents of cases of feminicides. Part of the collection was donated to Special Collection in New Mexico State University, the rest is in Casa Amiga.\nActivist and professor Julia Monarrez, author of Trama de una Injusticia: Feminicidio Sexual Sistémico en Ciudad Juárez, who has been working on a database with detailed information of cases in the 90s and more recently.\nActivist Ivonne Ramirez, creator of Ellas Tienen Nombre, who worked on a database of feminicides from 1993 to the present and visualized them in a digital map.\n\nFor the “Border Women and Feminist Cartography” (Fall 2023) course, the printed spreadsheet of El Silencio was chosen to be translated into English and was created into a digital spreadsheet with additional information found in the digital record in order for a larger audience to have access to this data in a digital platform and for non-Spanish speakers. The selection to make this spreadsheet created in the 90s in a digital and bilingual format is due to the generational divide since the issues of feminicides in the border region have been happening during an era that other digital tools and technologies were used and in the present there is a need to update these materials with current digital platforms and technologies to advance the processing and accessibility of previous data work done outside of academia or government institutions."

    "section": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?",
    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\nThe data was collected through research in newspapers reporting the cases, testimonios with the mothers and family members, and through, authorities reports and other legal documents. By consulting and researching from various sources, Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez) were putting the data of each case together in order to have a more complete image of each case.\nFor this project, the new data included was through web research to include digital news reports about cases published locally and internationally. Similarly, the translation to English was meticulously done in order to choose the words that best represent the meanings in Spanish considering how activists and those involved in the movement have determine certain words and specification to avoid the dehumanization of these women. With this in mind, any image or article on the internet that reinforced the interpretation of these cases as death bodies, pieces of body or disposable bodies was not included. Thus, the proceed of making this dataset in a digital and bilingual format followed previous research and observations from feminist scholars and human rights defenders to transfer ethical and responsible practices when working with data related to gender violence and feminicides across geopolitical, digital and linguistic borders.\nJasbeth Medrano, the leader overseeing the digitization and translation of the dataset, addresses: “Our second goal was achieved by putting the information on a digital spreadsheet that would make the data accessible to people without a copy of the book. We also wanted to translate the information from Spanish to English to ensure we could reach a larger audience. Each of these parts required a particular level of care and ethics, especially when translating. For example, there were certain abbreviations in the original dataset that my group assumed for the purpose of transcribing (i.e., my group assumed that “p. Negro” was referring to “pelo negro”, which we translated as “black hair”). We were also careful to not translate geographical locations, such as street names, because translating these points would result in inaccurate information (i.e. choosing to keep “Calle Oro” vs. “Gold Street”). In addition, we chose to place certain information in the same cell to make the spreadsheet easier to read, though this was done with careful consideration and group approval. These were only some of the aspects my team had to navigate through when constructing aspects of the data set, all of which we may have not considered had we not taken this course.” (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)"

    "text": "WHAT DATA IS MISSING? HOW IS UNCERTAINTY HANDLED?\nFrom the original spreadsheet, there is missing and non-identified data in the cases due to how the cases were handled by authorities where intersectional data violence was present by those in charge of the cases (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025). Nevertheless, the authors of this spreadsheet made plenty of efforts to include the most accurate and humanized data from each case, especially by bringing to their methodology the testimonios of the mother and other family members.\nThrough the process of making this spreadsheet a digital and translated dataset version, the project members realized that most of these cases are not registered nor processed in the digital record, which makes us question what would be the best practices and methods in incorporating them? The cases that are present in the digital record are most current ones where digital activism has been involved through hashtags and posts. The ones that are present from the early 90s are the ones that became internationally known and several news reports still circulate on the web."

    "section": "CONCLUSION",
    "text": "CONCLUSION\nThrough the intersection of data science and digital humanities through a transnational and transborder gender perspective, students in this course studied, cogitated, and reflected upon relevant digital, social, historical, cultural readings and works. One of the goals of this course was to aid students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Through the course’s readings and projects, students engaged hands-on in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing within feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping, and data science. The intersection between these lines of work is important and necessary because it prevents the continual “[hard-coding of] sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination into the digital infrastructure of our societies” (D’Ignazio & Klein 2020).\nAs Jasbeth Medrano articulated about their Dataset #2 analysis in the forthcoming article, “The Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities,” this course emphasized the importance of ethics, especially within her team’s methodology. She reflects that she valued the emphasis on ethics the course’s humanistic approaches to data from the most. Rather than being solely graded for the end product/project, the course prioritized student reflections throughout the process. Since the course taught students about the importance of leading each step with “careful consideration and intentionality,” Medrano and her team were able to apply many of these skills to their final dataset project. Lastly, Medrano reflects that it is “dire that future researchers investigate topics with humanistic approaches that stress working with communities, rather than working on them to avoid further harming individuals.”\nThrough Medrano’s reflections, we are able to trace a rich history. Starting with the authors who compiled and published _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra’s _dataset, we see “careful consideration and intentionality” in ensuring that the victims are portrayed as humanely as possible with an intentional feminist approach. These datasets do not cast blame on the victims or their families, but rather the authorities that let this happen. Through the translation and digitization of this dataset, the work of these original authors can be expounded upon and further developed. Many students spoke about using machine learning to create other forms of analysis, while considering the ethical implications of using these technologies.\nWhen weaving together Medrano and her team’s reflections and analyses, it is evident that the course provided a safe learning environment to cultivate their projects’ processes. Through the first five modules, students could freely explore and expand on their preferred digital tools and methodologies, which came into play during this final dataset project. Through these initial modules, students also constantly exercised and applied their understanding of ethics when converging these sensitive topics with their digital processes. As instructors, Fernández and Hernández-Trejo also expanded their own digital humanities pedagogy as well, making this a reciprocal experience for many in this course."

    "text": "TO DO\nThere are many ways that this dataset can be and should be expanded upon. We encourage further inquiry using this translated and digitized dataset for future projects related to transnational feminism, decolonial methodologies, and researching examples of grassroots counterdata. Some of the possible further explorations include using machine learning to find more information on the cases with missing data, which would further center the victims’ lives versus her cause of death. Information could include her achievements, her work, and her everyday life as a woman.\nAdditionally, these types of courses are very urgent and necessary in higher education as it prepares students to foster caring, ethical and responsible practices using, analyzing and designing technologies using data of violence issues that the world has been facing throughout centuries. In this course, we noticed that much of the sources were counterdata of gender violence and femincidies still exist in analog formats or in public spaces showing the need to foster solidarity initiatives that can work to digitize, digitally process, preserve and have accessibility protocols towards newspapers, letters, documents, photographs, artifacts, testimonios that hold a very valuable memory. Similarly, it is crucial to keep advocating for multilingual and translingual digital humanities and integrate materials and sources from different parts of the world in order to move out of the comfort zone and expose students to realistic research scenarios where data is multilingual (not just in English) and not easily accessible/legible.\n# 🚧 Under Construction 🚧"

How do historical biases in systems of literary production, preservation, and circulation figure into these kinds of claims? And how do we even define what counts as a novel?\nTo contextualize the initial list and dig into its claims about literary greatness, we collected information on each novel from a number of other databases, including Wikipedia, Goodreads, Project Gutenberg, the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), and Classify (a now-shuttered OCLC tool), which we have compiled here.\nThe dataset was created by Anna Preus and Aashna Sheth, who are also the authors of this data essay."

    "section": "HISTORY",
    "text": "HISTORY\nTo start, what is a novel? Today, novels are so prevalent that the term is often applied to a much wider range of books than it actually describes. “Novel” is an umbrella term for works of longform fiction in a range of genres: romance, sci-fi, historical fiction, horror, detective fiction, westerns, etc. The term generally does not apply–although these distinctions can sometimes be fuzzy–to short fiction, poetry, plays, biographies, or other non-fiction forms. The word “novel” was first used to describe a “long fictional prose narrative” in the 1600s, and the form increased in popularity across the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Interestingly, OCLC’s list of top 500 novels extends much further back than this. The oldest work on the list is The Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature written over 1,000 years ago.\nA key issue in literary studies is which books from the past we continue to read in the present, and which books from the present we will continue to read in the future. The vast majority of novels fall out of circulation shortly after they are published, quickly becoming part of what Margaret Cohen has called “the great unread.” When teachers assign texts in their classes and when literary scholars conduct research, they’re making choices about which texts continue to be valuable and important for people to read and study.\nThe term “canon” in literary studies refers to texts that continue to be considered important over time. Ankhi Mukherjee defines the canon as “a set of texts whose value and readability have borne the test of time” noting that this “ involves not merely a work’s admission into an elite club, but its induction into ongoing critical dialogue and contestations of literary value.” Canonical works continue to be read, taught, and discussed, and in popular terminology they’re often considered “classics.” These are works you might read in a high school English class: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, for example, or Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird.\nOne of the things that defines a classic is the fact that it stays in print for a long period of time. When a book is published, it is issued in an edition with a specific number of physical copies. If the book is profitable, it may be re-issued in different editions over many years, and edited repeatedly by different scholars across time. If it becomes a classic, it is likely to be issued in dozens or hundreds of editions even long after the author’s death.\nIn addition to classics, libraries are invested in making popular new novels available to readers. The Top 500 list includes many recently published best-sellers, including books in the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games series. Some highly popular books go on to become classics–Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations, which was wildly successful in its day, is a good example. Many popular texts, though, do not become canonical.\nBy focusing on the books that librarians around the world have chosen to continue to make available to readers, OCLC was able to create a list of widely read novels that includes both classic works and more recent, popular works that may not have received the same levels of literary acclaim. We wondered, though, how did OCLC’s data compare to other potential indicators of popularity or canonicity? And, for that matter, how was the list actually constructed?"

It was compiled based on analysis of data in WorldCat, which consists of catalog records created by librarians around the world, and entered into WorldCat.\nBuilding on this list, we compiled data from a number of other databases, including Project Gutenberg, VIAF, and Wikipedia–a process that is described in greater detail below."

The website for the list includes a “Librarians Kit” with a variety of publicity materials–from printable bookmarks to Instagram tiles-that can help bring attention to books in the Top 500 list within libraries’ collections.\n\nOur goal was to collect additional data to understand better how the list was constructed, and to contextualize and nuance its claims about literary greatness."

    "text": "WHAT’S IN THE DATA? WHAT MAKES A BOOK A “TOP NOVEL”?\nThe Top 500 list represents a massive data extraction and analysis effort on the part of OCLC. While they do not provide detailed information on how the list was compiled, they do offer a brief explanation of the process that went into creating the list on their FAQ page (written in the context of the top 100, but also applies to the top 500):\n\nMaterials in libraries are described and tracked in WorldCat in two ways. Any specific work of literature, music, art, history, etc., has an associated catalog record. This describes the item in a general sense. Every copy of the same book, for example, shares the same record. WorldCat also tracks library holdings, which indicate that a specific library has (or holds) at least one copy of that item.\n\n\nThe Library 100 is based on the total number of holdings for a specific novel across all libraries that have registered that information in WorldCat. When a library tells OCLC, “We have a copy of that book available,” that counts as a holding, and in the case of The Library 100, counts as +1 toward its ranking on the list.\n\nThis process initially sounds straightforward: to create the Top 500 list, the OCLC team presumably searched the title of a work, counted the number of libraries that held each title, and published the first 500. But it turns out it’s actually much more complicated than that. In WorldCat, records are stored by edition, meaning that each edition of a particular title has its own catalog record. An individual title like, say, Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote, may have been released in hundreds or thousands of editions since its initial publication.\nThis means that when developing the list, the OCLC team actually had to find all the editions of a specific title and sum the number of libraries that hold that edition across all editions. Thus the top 500 list is not only a representation of how many libraries carry the work, but a representation of how many times a book has been re-edited and re-issued; the more editions a book has, the more records are created and the more copies of a book a library may hold. Often, there are duplicate records for individual editions, which may affect the overall count of copies tallied by the OCLC. And when a work is translated into different languages, all the editions of all the translations are also recorded in WorldCat, which also figures into the count of total holdings for each novel."

    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA WAS ADDED?\nWe wanted to contextualize the Library Top 500 list by compiling additional information on each novel from a range of other sources. We focused on gathering three main categories of information: information that could help us understand what types of works–and whose works–were included on the list, data that could potentially provide alternate measures of popularity or canonicity, and the full text of each novel that was in the public domain. We collected information from the following sources:\nWorldCat: we used the now-shuttered OCLC tool Classify to gather data from WorldCat on the top 100 most widely held editions of each of the 500 novels on the list. We recorded total library holdings for these top 100 editions. We consider number of editions as a potential alternate measure of canonicity, although it is necessarily affected by the amount of time that has passed since the initial publication of the novel.\nVIAF: The Virtual International Authority File is an OCLC-run database that contains structured records–called “name authority files”–for individual authors and creators. We used VIAF to gather information on authors whose novels were included on the list, including their birth and death dates, nationalities, genders, and occupations.\n\n\n\nExamplf of author VIAF\n\n\nWikipedia: we used Wikipedia, the popular, free, volunteer-authored encyclopedia, to identify the year of first publication for each novel on the list.\nGoodreads: Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, is the largest social networking site related to books, with over 150 million members. Itt allows users to rate, review, and discuss a huge range of texts. We drew on data from Goodreads as a potential alternate indicator of texts’ popularity, collecting total number of reviews, total number of ratings, and average overall rating for each novel on the list.\nProject Gutenberg: We used Project Gutenberg to access the full-text of all novels on the list that are currently in the public domain, or in other words, out of copyright. We chose Project Gutenberg because their eBooks are edited by volunteers, whereas many larger content repositories, like Internet Archive and HathiTrust, only make available machine-generated transcriptions of historical texts, which tend to be less accurate.\nOur work creating this dataset not only builds on the work of the OCLC team who compiled the Top 500 list, but on the labor of the thousands of librarians who created records held in WorldCat and VIAF, of the volunteers who transcribed texts for Project Gutenberg and wrote articles for Wikipedia, and of the social media users who reviewed and rated books on Goodreads."

    "text": "ACKNOWLEDGING BIAS\nThe Top 500 List provides an unprecedented opportunity to consider what works libraries around the world have on their shelves. This, in turn, serves as an important indicator of books’ continued relevance to readers. As OCLC points out, “libraries offer access to trendy and popular books. But, they don’t keep them on the shelf if they’re not repeatedly requested by their communities over the years.”\nAt the same time, there are biases in what gets kept on library shelves, and in which library shelves are being considered. The libraries that OCLC works with are disproportionately located in Europe and North America and OCLC uses cataloging systems developed in English-language contexts. The list is distinctly skewed toward works by White, European and American men, as is much of the history of English literary production, but it is also difficult to tease apart this historical bias from potential compounding biases in the underlying data, in the data collection process, or in library cataloging systems more broadly.\nOCLC acknowledges broad biases in the list in a section titled, “Why isn’t the list more diverse?” writing, “The list emphasizes many books that we tend to think of as ‘classics,’ because those are the novels most often translated, retold in different editions, taught and widely distributed in library collections. Because of this, the list tends to reflect more dominant cultural views.” Although OCLC acknowledges this general bias towards works considered classics, more specific forms of bias aren’t made apparent in the list itself, which only includes the title and author for each novel.\n\nEach of these works and authors, of course, deserves careful consideration in their own right, but by compiling additional information into dataset, we can begin to see some of these biases as well as trends across the list more clearly."

WHAT MAKES A BOOK A “TOP NOVEL”?\nBy building on OCLC’s initial list and adding a range of information from other databases, we wanted to create a dataset that would offer opportunities to connect metadata analysis and full-text analysis in relation to a historically significant corpus of texts. To this end, we’ve included a brief exploration of the data below, as well as suggested activities, and some ideas for future areas of inquiry.\nWe split up our analysis into three portions: metadata analysis, rank analysis, and full-text analysis. You can follow our analysis in the notebook here. We first ask questions about the authors represented in the current top 500 list.

Would we want to create another metric?\nFor our purposes, we decided to use number of ratings, instead of average rating, as OCLC measures popularity by number of holdings, not how much patrons say they enjoy reading the books.\n\n\nCode\ndef top_5_comparison(col_name):\n  print(df[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\n  sorted = df.sort_values(by=[col_name])\n  print(sorted[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\ntop_5_comparison(\"gr_num_ratings_rank\")\n\n\n                                title                  author  top_500_rank  \\\n0                         Don Quixote     Miguel de Cervantes             1   \n1    Alice's Adventures in Wonderland           Lewis Carroll             2   \n2  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn              Mark Twain             3   \n3        The Adventures of Tom Sawyer              Mark Twain             4   \n4                     Treasure Island  Robert Louis Stevenson             5   \n\n   gr_num_ratings_rank  \n0                  211  \n1                  133  \n2                   68  \n3                   88  \n4                  145  \n                                     title               author  top_500_rank  \\\n44   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone         J.K.

The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP"

We’ll explain some specific dimensions of the collection we’ve put together below, including how to search and sort through the material. Under a separate tab, we’ll also suggest some possible classroom exercises that might make this collection useful for students who are learning about African American poetry for the first time. However, first we’ll briefly introduce the concept of African American American Periodical Poetry."

    "text": "African American Periodical Poetry: a Bit of Background\nIn their poetry, African American writers argued for Civil Rights, challenged the unjust practices and racialized violence that were prevalent in American life, and worked out new and distinctive aesthetic concepts. At the beginning of the twentieth century, African American poetry was not so much a ‘literary’ movement as it was a part of popular culture, with hugely popular and influential figures like Paul Laurence Dunbar and an important element of African American Vernacular writing and performance linked to the oral tradition (Ramey, A History of African American Poetry, 2019). However, by the 1920s, changes in the style and function of the poetry was evident, and these changes can be readily traced in poetry published in periodicals.\nThe overall conception of this project borrows from Modernist Periodical Studies, led by scholars such as Sean Latham (“The Rise of Periodical Studies,” 2006), Robert Scholes and Clifford Wulfman (Modernism in the Magazines, 2010), and Adam McKible and Suzanne Churchill (Little Magazines and Modernism, 2005). It is also deeply invested in the field that has come to be known as Black Digital Humanities scholarship; we hope our work will be legible as in the vein of Kim Gallon’s “technology of recovery” (“Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities, 2016), where an important goal is to make under-studied materials accessible and legible to a broad readership, including readers outside of academia. Other scholarship that has influenced our own includes the Colored Conventions Project (Foreman, Casey, and Patterson, 2021), and Roopika Risam’s New Digital Worlds(2018). And more generally, we see our work as continuing to fill in a continuing problem of the “Archive Gap,” where minoritized writers often continue to be under-studied and under-curated in major digital collections, with knock-on effects for quantitative analysis based on textual corpora (see Singh, “Beyond the Archive Gap,” 2020)."

    "text": "Why These Particular Periodicals? The Black Press and the Advent of “Crossover” Publications\nWe have attempted to build a comprehensive collection of African American periodical poetry from the early 20th century, arranging it so that visitors to this site can search and sort based on their own research questions. We believe that the creation of this collection will allow both serous scholars as well as students and those new to the field to see the full richness and range of African American poetry from this period in new ways.\nThe Black Press. First and foremost, we believe that in order to understand how African American poetry developed and grew in the years covered by this project, it’s important to engage with the primary venue through which that poetry was published and read – the Black press. For many poets in this Anthology, African American-oriented periodicals were the first destination for poetry. Magazine publication was how Black poets found readers and developed a sense of community, and the collections we have produced for this project hopefully show some powerful emerging networks and conversations about the role of literature in civil rights activism, questions of aesthetics, and questions of language. Also, at least until the mid-1920s, publication in mainstream venues like Poetry or Vanity Fair was extremely rare for African American poets, so venues like The Crisis and Opportunity were often the best way to get published.\nTo be sure, the poetry published by these magazines is of quite varying quality and importance to literary historians. Rather than evaluate or curate the materials based on our particular tastes or preexisting consensus, our aspiration here is to make _all_of the periodical poetry we can find accessible to readers with the hope that it will be helpful to different kinds of research projects and questions. Putting everything together in one place, as we have attempted to do here, can sometimes reveal alignments and patterns that might not have previously been visible. What might readers discover? What new questions can we ask?\n1900-1920: A somewhat overlooked era in African American poetry. The field of African American periodical poetry was quite active in the first two decades of the 20th century, though many of the magazines where poetry was published were not well-preserved, and are today only available in fragments. Two important magazines from the first decade of the twentieth century that have been been well-preserved and digitized are Voice of the Negro (Atlanta and Chicago, 1904-1907) and Colored American Magazine (Boston and New York, 1900-1908). Both printed a considerable amount of poetry, and we have included a substantial number of poems from these magazines in our current collection (note: our collection of poetry from these two magazines is not quite complete). W.E.B. Du Bois also edited two magazines that appeared only briefly in this period, Moon Illustrated Weekly (1905-1906), and Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line (1907-1910). Horizon did not appear to print much in the way of poetry; Moon Illustrated Weekly printed poems only occasionally. Both magazines have only been partially preserved. At present, those magazines are sparsely represented in our collection.\nThe Crisis became a major vehicle for poetry publication starting in 1910, under Du Bois’ editorship. It was an especially important venue for Georgia Douglas Johnson, who published more than 30 poems in the magazine during this period; we also see substantial numbers of poems published by writers like James D. Corrothers, Joseph S. Cotter, and Lucian B. Watkins – writers who were well known at this time, but who subsequently dropped off the critical radar. Du Bois himself published several notable poems in The Crisis during this period, and these poems are included in our collection. One particularly active theme in late 1910s poetry is World War I (see the Glossary in a separate tab for other themes).\nThe 1920s: The Crisis, Opportunity, and The Messenger.  There were three very large and successful African American magazines in the 1920s, all published in New York but with national circulations: The Crisis, Opportunity, _and The Messenger. With The Crisis, there appears to have been a steady build-up of interest in poetry through the 1910s, leading up to Jessie Fauset’s taking on the role of literary editor between 1919-1926. With her work at The Crisis, Fauset brought a serious literary sensibility to the magazine and a considerable increase in quality.\nWith regards to Opportunity: as biographers for writers like Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes have documented, the racially-integrated Opportunity “prize” dinners in 1924, 1925, and 1926 seemed to function at least in part as coming out parties for emerging writers, helping to create a sense of excitement about African American poetry both within the Black community and beyond it. White editors and publishers like Paul Kellogg and Horace Liveright attended a particularly important dinner at the Harlem Civic Club in March of 1924, which led to the idea of the special issue devoted to African American writing in Survey Graphic (March 1925), guest-edited by Alain Locke.\nThe mid-1920s as tipping point for African American poetry. As we’ve developed our collection of African American periodical poetry, it’s become clearer and clearer that the mid- and late-1920s was a special moment of growth and recognition. First and foremost, there is the remarkable proliferation of African American general interest magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity, as mentioned above. The same period also saw the emergence of several African American literary magazines, including Fire!! in New York in 1926, Black Opals in Philadelphia in 1927-1928, and Saturday Evening Quill in Boston from 1928-1930. Fire!! ran for only a single issue; Black Opals ran for four issues, and featured many prominent names despite having a fairly tiny print run (250 copies of each issue were printed). Saturday Evening Quill, for its part, was essentially the house magazine for a vibrant African American literary social club active in the late 1920s in Boston. In the present collection, we have collected poems from each of these magazines.\nLast but not least, several mainstream publications open their pages to special issues devoted to African American poetry during this period. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the special March 1925 issue of Survey Graphic guest-edited by Alain Locke, which would become the basis for the hugely influential anthology The New Negro: an Interpretation (1925). There were also special issues dedicated to African American poetry published by modernist little magazines like Palms (guest-edited by Countee Cullen), as well as The Carolina Magazine, which did excellent issues on African American poetry, guest-edited by Lewis Alexander. This growing engagement from the mainstream was also reflected of course in the fact that mainstream commercial publishers in New York and Boston were also publishing significant quantities of African American poetry during this time period. Success in periodical publication often led to book-length poetry collections – Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and James Weldon Johnosn all published book-length collections of poetry with mainstream New York publishers in the subsequent years. (Sadly, writers who were women did not appear to have this same benefit.)\nAlongside the Special Issues described above, Claude McKay published a number of poems, especially in Max Eastman-edited magazine, The Liberator (not to be confused with William Lloyd Garrison’s magazine of the same name from the mid-19th century). McKay is somewhat anomalous in that he published much more outside of the Black press than he did within it (though he is certainly well-represented in The Crisis)."

We also relied on the digitized versions of _Saturday Evening Quill _at the University of Delaware’s library. And a colleague at North Carolina State University, Madhusudan Kutti, was kind enough to send us a digitized copy of the 1926 special issue of Palms we have included in the collection; it was not available elsewhere. Our own work entailed reading the issues, locating poetry published in them, and creating text versions. We also made an effort to describe the poetic form, mark down thematic tags (“Progress and Racial Uplift”; “Motherhood”; etc.). (See the Glossary of Themes and Forms Tab for more)\nThe lead researcher on this project is Amardeep Singh, a professor of English at Lehigh University. He has been creating digital projects related to minoritized writers for several years, beginning with projects like “Claude McKay’s Early Poetry” and “Women of the Early Harlem Renaissance.” Since 2022, he has been developing a larger project called “African American Poetry: A Digital Anthology” (AAPADA), a Scalar project that aims to be a comprehensive collection of poetry by Black writers that is out of copyright. The poems collected for this dataset are also presented in simple text versions on AAPADA.\nKate Hennessey, a Lehigh University graduate student, assisted with the collection of the data as well as the editing and formatting of poems during the spring of 2024. Other Lehigh graduate students have been involved with the project, either as paid graduate research assistants or as students in seminars, whose research and editing skills have at times been added to the project (with full credit and permission). Other recent students who have contributed to the project include Miranda Alvarez Guillen and Christian Farrior. Several of the students involved in the project are people who identify as Black."

    "text": "How might this dataset – and the collection of texts behind it – be used? \nThere are any number of ways this collection might be used.\nLiterary Prestige and Canonization. While some poets saw their careers and reputations take off during the peak years of the Harlem Renaissance, other writers were largely left by the wayside. By examining the “Prize-Winning” keyword under “Themes,” users can zoom in on poems and poets who dominated the literary prize contests at magazines like _Opportunity _and _The Crisis _starting in the mid-1920s. Another way of exploring the impact of individual poems might be to note poems that were republished in multiple venues (see the column “Second Venue” in the dataset along those lines). The fact that a poem was repeatedly reprinted might be an indication of its literary cachet and social impact.\nGender. Another use might be to study changing gender distributions over the time period at issue. In the early years of the 20th century, poetry published in magazines like _Colored American Magazine _and Voice of the Negro was overwhelmingly dominated by poets who were men. By the 1920s, there was a significant uptick in poetry by women; how and where this was occurring could be studied in greater detail.\nAnother intriguing question is the role of editors who were women. Jessie Fauset played an important role at The Crisis through the 1910s through the mid-1920s; editors who were women also played important roles at Colored American Magazine (Pauline Hopkins), and Black Opals (Nellie Bright, Gwendolyn Bennett).\nAs of this writing, we are unaware of any African American poets from this period who identified as transgender or non-binary in our collection. If we come to learn more about authors’ gender identity that might lead us to add additional gender identity categories, we will do that.\nPoetic Form. Scholars interested in the evolution of African American poetic forms in the early 20th century might want to explore our Poetic Form column. At the beginning of this period, most published poetry by Black poets was in rhymed, accented verse (often using the Common Measure); following the dominant trend in American poetry in the mid-1920s, there was an explosion of Free Verse in many of the magazines. The collection also contains a large number of African American Sonnets (written throughout the period), as well as experiments with the Blues, Elegies, and a number of other forms.\nThe Impact of Editors and Author-Editors. Editors played a huge role in encouraging African American poets in these various magazines. Some editors were also poets themselves. The poet Countee Cullen was on the masthead as an Associate Editor at Opportunity during the peak of his fame (1927-1928); he also guest-edited a special issue of the little magazine Palms in 1926, which probably informed his subsequent decision to edit the 1927 collection, Caroling Dusk. Jessie Fauset, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Lewis Alexander were all poets who also served as guest-editors or associate editors in various magazines during this period.\nPredominantly Black vs. Predominantly White Publications. We have marked whether the magazines where poems where published were “predominantly White” or “predominantly Black.” In the 1920s in particular, there was a striking increase in the number of predominantly White publications that ran special issues devoted to African American poetry. Some of these were especially high-impact events (especially the special issue of Survey Graphic in March 1925). This too could be studied, especially in connection with other attributes (for instance, one sees that the Survey Graphic special issue mentioned above was especially influential; but the issue is far more lopsided towards poets who were men than one sees in predominantly Black publications from the same time period).\nWhite poets? As magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity became more prominent as national publications in the 1920s, they also had a substantial readership that was White. And with Countee Cullen playing a prominent role as an Associate Editor at Opportunity in 1927-1928, there were quite a few poets who were White publishing in these magazines. At present, we have excluded these writers from the collection. A future version of this project might include White poets who engaged with racial justice issues in the Black press (there were many who did, and their work has not been given much critical attention).\nFrequency of publication and authorial prestige. Poets like Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen published many poems in several different magazines during this period (both predominantly Black and predominantly White magazines). But poets who are less well-known today were also highly prolific – one thinks especially of Georgia Douglas Johnson (who has approximately 50 poems represented in this dataset). However, some writers who published much less went on to have an outsized impact on the basis of relatively few poems – one thinks of Helene Johnson, Mae V. Cowdery, and Arna Bontemps along those lines.\nExploring lesser-known authors. Many poems in the dataset were published by poets who did not aspire to have careers as poets; they may have only published one or two poems. Others (such as Edward S. Silvera and Lewis Alexander) were accomplished poets who were well-known to their peers, but might have dropped off abruptly (Edward Silvera died quite young, at age 31). And there are a few authors who published five or more poems included in this collection about whom we have been able to find nothing (one such name might be Ann Lawrence [also known as Ann Lawrence-Lucas]; she published several thoughtful poems in The Messenger in the mid-1920s)."

    "text": "Glossary: Topics, Themes, and Forms\nAs we’ve been adding poetry to this collection, we’ve been marking various thematic areas of interest. These tags can be a good way to explore our collection and see patterns and begin to emerge between and among authors featured on this site.\nHistorical Events and Tribute Poems\n\nWorld War I. This tag will be especially interesting to readers interested in African American writers responding to World War I, especially in the 1910s. Some writers took a critical eye to how Black soldiers were treated, and the difficulty of mustering patriotic feeling in a society that treated Black folks as second-class citizens. (14 poems with this tag)\nSpanish-American War. Poems dealing with African American soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war, including the Philippine War that followed (mainly 1900-1910).\n\nSlavery. Many of these writers were writing in living memory of the slavery era, and had relatives who had been enslaved. Paul Laurence Dunbar, for instance, was born to parents who had been enslaved. For Black writers in this period, grappling with the legacy of slavery was an important and ongoing topic. (33 poems with this tag)\nLynching and Racialized Violence. Thousands of African American people were brutally murdered in extrajudicial mob killings – lynchings – in this period. This was a topic that was widely covered in the Black press, especially in magazines like The Crisis. A few poems directly address this horrific phenomenon. Under this tag, we also include poems dealing with racialized violence (such as race riots) that might not strictly speaking be understood as lynchings. (21 poems with this tag)\nFrederick Douglass. Tribute poems for Frederick Douglass.\nPaul Laurence Dunbar. Tribute poems for Paul Laurence Dunbar.\nAbraham Lincoln. Poems by Black poets commemorating President Abraham Lincoln.\nCivil War. Poems by Black poets reflecting on the Civil War (1861-1865).\n\nSocial and Political Themes\n\nRace. Many, many poems in this collection might be tagged as dealing with race in some way, so over time we have added additional differentiations for two especially important subtopics: “Race: Identity formation” and “Race: Black Beauty.” (100+ poems with some version of this tag)\nRacism. Poems tagged with “racism” deal explicitly with racialized hostility, segregation, and its effects on the African American community.\nProgress and Racial Uplift. Poems thematizing racial progress, uplift, and the civil rights movement. (Approximately 44 poems in the collection are tagged this way)\nQueer and Homoerotic. Poems dealing with same-sex desire or LGBTQIA identities. Several important writers from this period are known from biographical evidence to have been LGBTQIA; here we have tagged only poems that seem to explicitly reflect same-sex or queer desire.\nMotherhood. This is a rich topic, especially for poets from the 1910s. Some of the most memorable poetry thematizing motherhood is written by Georgia Douglas Johnson. (18 poems with this tag)\nInterracial, Multiracial, and Race Relations. Poems dealing with relationships that cross racial borders, including friendships, antagonistic relationships, and romances. We also use this category for poems that reference mixed-race people, such as Georgia Douglas Johnson’s “The Octoroon.” (21 poems with this tag)\nReligion. Poems representing engagement with religion, including both the affirmative embrace of Christianity in the interest of civil rights and more critical engagements.\nLabor. Poems dealing with class and labor relations. (approx. 30 poems with this tag)\nTravel, Migration and Great Migration. This was a period in which many African American writers were on the move, and this tag references poems that deal with travel in Europe or Africa. It is also used for poems dealing with the Great Migration, the massive movement of Black folks from the U.S. south to northern amd midwestern cities that began in the early 1900s and continued through the 1940s. (approx. 28 poems with this tag)\nPatriotism. Poems exploring the often conflicted relationship many African American writers had with questions of patriotism and national pride.\n\nPlaces / Regions / Institutions\n\nHarlem. As is well-known, Harlem was the epicenter of the Black cultural community that emerged in the 1920s, and many poets celebrated it in their writing, including Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and many others.\nHBCU. Many Black writers from this period were associated with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in some way. Some – notably Langston Hughes – attended HBCUs and received degrees there. Others, including Alain Locke, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charles Johnson, and Zora Neale Hurston, taught at HBCUs. There are many references to universities like Fisk University, Howard University, Atlanta University, and so on in the poetry of this period.\nAfrica. Poems that thematize Africa in some way. Imagining Africa was an important theme for many Black poets in the early 20th century – both those involved with the UNIA and Garveyism and more broadly. Africa was especially vivid to Langston Hughes, as he had a memorable visit to West Africa early in his career.\n\nCaribbean. Writers like Claude McKay and Eric Walrond had direct Caribbean connections, and often wrote about it in their works. But others – especially Langston Hughes – also engaged the Caribbean in their writing. The Caribbean was also important to Arthur Schomburg, who immigrated to the U.S. from Puerto Rico in 1891.\n\nOther Themes and Forms\n\nSonnet. Poems using the sonnet form. The sonnet form was highly prevalent in African American poetry during this period. Claude McKay famously used sonnets in many of his most influential political poems. Writers like Georgia Douglas Johnson and Carrie Williams Clifford also found the sonnet form appealing, again, in connection with social justice-oriented poetry. (approx. 75 poems with this tag)\nVarious other poetic forms: Common Measure, Villanelle, Terza Rima, Elegy, Ode, Haiku, Ballad, Free Verse, Blues\nPrize-winning poems. Poems that won one of the poetry prize competitions from the mid-1920s, sponsored by either The Crisis or Opportunity magazine. (32 poems with this tag)\nMusic. The emphasis on music in poems by Langston Hughes is well-known, but in fact many Black poets from this period were interested in the connections between music and lyricism.\nIntertextual. Poems that allude to other authors, including white authors.\nBlack Vernacular (AAVE). Poems using AAVE. There were active debates at the time among Black poets about the use of language that was sometimes seen as caricaturing Black voices.\nPoetry for children. Many well-known African American writers of this period wrote poems for children on occasion, including especially Langston Hughes and Jessie Fauset."

    "title": "U.S. National Park Visit Data (1979-2023)",
    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\nThe very first National Park — Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming — was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. A handful of other parks — Sequoia, Yosemite, Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake — joined the system in the next several decades. While the National Parks were originally created to protect precious, beautiful lands and to make them accessible to the public — a noble goal — it’s important to remember that these lands were taken, often forcibly, from Native American people who already owned, lived, and worked on them (Beauchamp 2020). Today, there are still calls for the NPS to return the lands of the National Parks to Indigenous people.\nScholars have similarly shown that early conservation movements, which spurred the development of the National Parks, were troublingly intertwined with racism and eugenics movements (Beauchamp 2020). These prejudiced origins, combined with continuing forms of environmental racism, have contributed to the marginalization of people of color and other minorities in the parks; research has shown that white people visit the parks much more than other demographic groups(Weber and Sultana 2013; Alba et al. 2022; Floyd and Johnson 2002). The National Parks are not equally accessible to everyone in the same way, and these exclusions shape the park visitation data even before it’s counted.\nVisit counting, according to the NPS, started a long time ago — as early as 1904 (more than 10 years before the National Park Service itself was officially created). However, at this time, their data collection methods were mostly informal, inconsistent, and low-tech. But over the next century, the NPS worked hard to make their methods more reliable, consistent, and technologically advanced.\nA big catalyst for the NPS getting serious about data collection was a new law. In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources (i.e. to buying up more land and water so that condo developers couldn’t do it first) and to expanding outdoor recreation infrastructure in the U.S.\nBecause this act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each area should be “proportional to visitor use,” the NPS buckled down on counting visitor use. Over the next twenty years, they accordingly “developed and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.”\nWhile today’s National Park data collection system is more formal and sophisticated than the one that the NPS used in 1904, there are still many inconsistencies, flaws, and limitations. These shortcomings are largely unavoidable. Think about it. Would it be possible to record *every* *single* *visit* to *every* *single* National Park… *ever*? We’re talking about 60 different parks and dozens of different geographic areas (mountains, volcanoes, deserts, canyons, wetlands, forests, islands, and more); over 40 years; in countless changing weather conditions; amidst various economic fluctuation and National Park staff support and funding; and hundreds of millions of people who are walking, hiking, backpacking, driving, boating, biking, skiing, and more. It’s just not possible. However, we believe this data is useful to study precisely for this reason: because it helps demonstrate that data never reflects reality precisely.\nAnd yet the National Park visit data also demonstrates why collecting and analyzing data, even if it is flawed and approximate, is sometimes worthwhile — if (big if) you fully understand the data’s flaws, limitations, and history, and if you incorporate these considerations into all subsequent analyses, interpretations, and takeaways."

    "text": "Where did the data come from? Who collected it?\nThe National Park data on this website was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, a specific program tasked with coordinating visitor statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members across all 63 parks were also involved in the data collection process.\nThe original data was made available through the NPS’s Visitor Use Statistics data portal. Through this portal, you can generate reports and download data for many different park visitation categories and time periods — at both national and individual park levels. To download the data included here, we first selected “National Reports” in the data portal, and we then selected the “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)” report type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Selections for National Park visit data generated with “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)”\n\n\n\nFor “Park Types,” we selected only “National Parks”; for “Years,” we selected all possible years (1979-2023); for “Regions,” we selected all possible regions; for “Field Type,” we selected only “Recreation Visits” (excluding “NonRecreation Visits,”” “Recreation Hours,” “NonRecreation Hours,” “Concessioner Lodging,” “Concessioner Camping,” “Tent Campers,” “RV Campers,” “Backcountry Campers,” “NonRecreation Overnight Stays,” and “Miscellaneous Overnight Stays”); for “Additional Fields,” we selected “State” and “Region”. We also selected the option of viewing the report as an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts).\nIf you choose to download this report as a CSV file, it will unfortunately not look exactly like the report pictured in Figure 1; instead, the CSV will include all visit and use types, and it will include visit/use information by month rather than aggregated by year. When I have compiled this data to share with my students in the past, I have sometimes downloaded the CSV file and then removed the columns that I’m not interested in and aggregated the data by year programatically. In other cases, I have simply copied and pasted the annual summary report into a CSV file.\nIn either case, it is usually necessary to explicitly transform the format of the “RecreationVisits” column into a number and to remove the commas that separate the numbers by thousands (a transformation that you can do with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets or with a programming language) Finally, we published the data to this project’s GitHub repository for easier storage and access."

    "text": "Why was the data collected? How is the data used?\nThe NPS collects visit data partly because the government requires it, as we’ve already discussed. But the NPS also uses the visit data for other internal purposes — to determine which parks need more staff members and programming, which hiking trails need more maintenance, or which visitor centers need more bathrooms.\nThe visit data also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best provide and share resources, like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. If millions more hikers started to come to Mt. Rainier, for example, that would be a very important thing for the surrounding community to know. To consider just one consequence of this increase, those hikers would likely need more ambulance trips and rescue helicopters, and you wouldn’t want visitors to the local National Park booking up all the emergency vehicles in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 2021 report on NPS economic impact // Graphic by NPS\n\n\n\nThe visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact—economic and otherwise—that the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large (Figure 2). These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, and attention.\nThe data is also frequently reported on by journalists, who use it to highlight the most popular parks and noteworthy visitation records, as well as to point their readers to parks where they might be able to find some peace and quiet (see articles in Thrillist, Smithsonian, and CNN)."

What’s actually in this dataset, and what “counts” as a visit?\nTo get started, let’s load the dataset and examine a random sample of rows.\n\n\nCode\n# https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/\n\n# Load the dplyr package\nlibrary(dplyr, warn = FALSE)\n\n# Load National Park Visitation data\nnp_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context/main/datasets/national-parks/US-National-Parks_RecreationVisits_1979-2023.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n## Look at the structure of the dataset, randomly sample 10 rows\nnp_data %&gt;% slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nLake Clark NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1997\n9173\n\n\nCongaree NP\nSoutheast\nSC\n2018\n145929\n\n\nCrater Lake NP\nPacific West\nOR\n2002\n456620\n\n\nYellowstone NP\nIntermountain\nWY\n2007\n3151343\n\n\nZion NP\nIntermountain\nUT\n2022\n4692417\n\n\nBryce Canyon NP\nIntermountain\nUT\n1986\n578018\n\n\nGlacier Bay NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n2018\n597915\n\n\nCarlsbad Caverns NP\nIntermountain\nNM\n1993\n687161\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2021\n11540\n\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains NP\nSoutheast\nTN\n2018\n11421200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see five columns – “ParkName”, “Region”, “State”, “Year”, and “RecreationVisits.” The first four are pretty self-explanatory, but why is the fifth labelled “RecreationVisits” rather than “Visits” or “Visitors”?\nIt turns out that the NPS distinguishes between kinds of visits to their parks. There are “recreation” visits — when people are visiting the parks for fun, vacation, exercise, etc. — and there are “non-recreation” visits — when people are visiting the parks for other reasons. For example, some people need to travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through the park, or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a National Park on all sides). Other people are visiting the parks because they have actual business to conduct in the parks.\nHere’s a full list of “reportable non-recreation” visitsaccording to the NPS:\n\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that “recreation visit” counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we’ll discuss more below).\nIt also means that they’re not counting individual people. This data doesn’t tell us anything about the people who are visiting.\n(Note: The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota is located inside Badlands National Park (the visitor center is on the reservation), which could be worth discussing here.)"

    "text": "How was the data collected?\nSo how does the NPS actually count these recreation visits? Take a moment and see if you come up with a few guesses…\nIt turns out that each park counts visits differently. And at many parks, each entrance at each park even counts visits differently.\nIf you go to the “Park Reports” tab in the NPS Data Portal, you can look up an individual park and download a PDF file called “Visitor Use Counting Procedures,” which details exactly what procedures they use to count visits at this park. Most of the parks have several PDFs because their counting procedures have changed many times over the years!\nTo count visits, most parks use a combination of automatic traffic counters and manual counting—that is, staff members who use their eyeballs to literally count the number of people arriving by foot, bike, bus, cross-country skis, snowmobile, boat, canoe, etc. Perhaps most interesting, they usually take those counts and then apply a specifically designed mathematical formula to arrive at the most accurate estimate of number of recreation visits — adding, subtracting, and multiplying the counts based on a variety of factors, such as the season or the entrance (e.g. assuming that more people would likely be arriving in a car in the summer months at the most popular gate than in the winter months at the least popular gate) or how many non-recreation visits they expect are a confounding factor.\nThis browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: &lt;a href=\"other_docs/Everglades_Visitor-Use-Counting-Procedures_2023.pdf\"&gt;Download PDF&lt;/a&gt;\nFor example, at Everglades National Park, at the Shark Valley Entrance, there is a pneumatic tube traffic counter that counts the number of cars that pass over it. The staff members then apply different mathematical operations to this number in order to arrive at what they think is the most accurate estimate of recreation visits:\n\nThe traffic count is divided by 2 to account for entry and exit. The adjusted traffic count is reduced by the number of buses, the number of bicycles counted when the entrance station is open, 127 bicycles per month to account for after-hours use, and by 200 non-recreation vehicles per month October through May and 100 non-recreation vehicles per month June through September. The traffic count is further reduced by 350 non-reportable (NPS) vehicles per month. The reduced count is multiplied by 2.17 persons per vehicle.\n\nWhat’s more, the devices that the NPS uses to count visits, like pneumatic tube counters or induction loop counters (magnetised coils of wire that are installed under a road, and that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them) sometimes break.\n\n\n\nAn example of a pneumatic tube traffic counter, installed above the road\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop, installed beneath a road (making it harder to detect when it breaks!)\n\n\nFor example, according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances at Crater Lakes National Park broke in 2012 and wasn’t repaired for at least a year:\n\n2/1/2012 | The Traffic Counter at Annie Springs Entrance Station was not functioning properly and therefore we have a count of zero.\n\n\n3/1/2012 | Broken counter at Annie Springs Entrance, unable to record numbers.\n\n\n4/1/2012 | Traffic counter was broken for the beginning of the month and may have low numbers.\n\n\n10/1/2012 | Counts estimated by Butch\n\n\n11/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n12/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n1/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\n\n2/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\nYou can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears that visits have been declining since around 2019:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decline may, in part, be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut the NPS logs also show that the main induction loop counter at Carlsbad Caverns broke in 2019 and has remained broken for multiple years:\n\n9/1/2019 | Traffic counter apparently has been broken since July. Traffic counts are estimated.\n\n\n4/1/2020 | Main road traffic counter is broken, I have estimated the count.\n\n\n12/1/2020 | Corona virus closure that began in November ended on December 4th. Main road traffic counter remains broken.Possible problem with Loop Road counter.\n\n\n4/1/2022 Main road traffic counter remains broken. Rattlesnake Springs traffic counter seems to be off, I will henceforth provide estimates.\n\n\n9/1/2023 | Loop Road and backcountry closed due to flood damage. Slaughter Canyon Cave remains closed Traffic counter on main road remains broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve talked about how data is collected (and the fragility of some of those methods), it’s a good time to think about how even the same method, deployed at different places, might be differently unreliable. For more, see Activity 1."

    "text": "What data is missing? How is uncertainty handled?\nIf you filter the data and examine the least visited National Parks across these many decades, you’ll notice that there are some parks that had zero visitors in a given year.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for minimum RecVisits\nleast_visited &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(RecreationVisits == min(RecreationVisits))\n\n# Number of rows for least visited\nnum_rows &lt;- nrow(least_visited)\n\n# Show some of them\nleast_visited  %&gt;% slice_sample(n = min(10, num_rows))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2015\n0\n\n\nNational Park of American Samoa\nPacific West\nAS\n2003\n0\n\n\nKatmai NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1995\n0\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2014\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might guess that there are no visits in these years because these parks are all located in remote places that are hard to get to, like rural Alaska or American Samoa.\nIf we look at the visitation trends for Kobuk Valley National Park, for example, we can see that a couple of years with zero visits isn’t a huge aberration:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[6]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it turns out that in 2014 and 2015, Kobuk Valley National Park actually didn’t count visitors at all.\nIf we look at the visitation reports for Kobuk Valley in 2014, they say that “the park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.” But even though they didn’t count visitors at all, they still recorded a zero in those two years. This hard number makes it seem conclusive, like there really were zero people people who stepped onto the park lands in those years.\nIn 2015, John Quinley, the Alaska regional spokesperson for the NPS, spoke with the Anchorage Daily News about this issue, and he admitted that “it might have been better if park statisticians had put something other than a zero in the visitor box for 2014 — say maybe a question mark.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nWhy would you or wouldn’t you want to record a question mark in this dataset? What else could you use to record uncertainty?\n\n\nThe decision not to record visits in certain years seems reasonable on its face, but we’ve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that, when faced with a similar situation, chose to provide an estimate for a certain year based on average counts from previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited. This matters because, as we’ve discussed, there are financial, political, and social ramifications of these visit count numbers."

But they will also get fixed at different rates, in different locations, as we could see in the case of Crater Lake National Park (where a counter was fixed quickly) and Carlsbad Caverns National Park (where a broken counter from 2019 still has not been fixed).\nThere are many reasons for these disparities, but some of the big ones might be geography and resources. The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP"

    "section": "THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT",
    "text": "THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT\nSections in the following section comes from Fernández Quintanilla & Bejarano’s “Fuerza Feminista: Confronting Intersectional Data Violence by Archiving the Movement against Anti-Feminicides in the Paso del Norte Region” (forthcoming 2025) and Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano’s “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities” (forthcoming 2025).\nThe specific topic the “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” course focused on gender violence and the feminicidios in the transborder region of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, El Paso, Texas, and Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The course first focused on a localized perspective in this transborder region before shifting to a broader U.S. and global perspective.\nFor over thirty years, the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua bordering Texas and New Mexico have experienced and witnessed multiple forms of violence across its rural and urban regions. Communities are besieged with cartels and gender-based violence, and the saturation of international corporations that pay workers less than livable wages for workers in Ciudad Juárez. An overwhelming amount of attention has focused on Ciudad Juárez for cases of feminicide pointing to the early 1990s as a period when families of disappeared and murdered women, activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and national and international human rights regimes clamored over the hundreds of women and girls who disappeared and were never found, or whose remains were located near or within Ciudad Juárez (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Lagarde y de los Ríos, 2010; Driver, 2015; Lozano, 2019). Concentrated attention was given to the feminicides at that time, but over the years, less focus has been given to the galvanizing efforts of local people to demand responses from authorities to resolve these atrocities. (From Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\nDespite the increased social awareness, local community activism, formation of local organizations and nonprofits, and foreign academic interventions—there is still no satisfactory response from Mexican authorities regarding Mexican feminicidios. Among the notable and progressive changes that have occurred to bring justice to the murdered women and girls is the legal classification of feminicide, or feminicidio, as Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos coined and inserted into Mexican legal framework, which she co-proposed and co-created (Monárrez Fregoso, Rosa-Linda, and Bejarano 2020). The term femicide emerged from Diana Russell and Jill Radford’s Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing (1992), which proposed a feminist approach in addressing the disproportionate killing of women by differentiating these murders from general homicides. Although the direct translation of femicide to Spanish is femicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos argued that it was not enough to classify these murders as separate from homicide; thus, she coined feminicidio. By naming feminicide, feminicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos expanded on the definition of femicide to “name the ensemble of violations of women’s human rights, which contain the crimes against and the disappearances of women” (2020). The term feminicidio acknowledges that the killing of women is an institutional and systemic violence, meaning that feminicidios occur because of the authorities’ omission, negligence, and/or collusion with the assailants which inhibits women’s access to justice and thereby contributes to impunity.\nYet, even with the legal designation of feminicidios as a form of institutional gender violence, there is much work to be done. Many well-meaning (and sometimes, not so well-meaning) works of art, novels, and films have inadvertently contributed to sensationalizing Ciudad Juárez’s feminicides (Driver 2015). Rather than garnering awareness as intended, some of these media formats have fallen into entertainment categories, further dehumanizing these women and girls’ deaths. With this precedent, it is essential to mention that local community members, such as the victims’ mothers, family members, academics, journalists, and many others in the region and in different parts of the world have been actively archiving and collecting data regarding the feminicides. (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)\nPeople in Chihuahua and the greater border region have engaged in transnational movements to stop gender-based violence by implementing diverse data and record-keeping processes to hold state systems accountable. Everyday people played an active role in pursuing justice in response to backlogged and slow-moving justice systems and negligent authorities working within crumbling infrastructures, which caused other forms of violence against feminicide victims’ families when state systems blamed, ignored, or outright rejected families’ demands to solve these crimes. Families, activists, and human rights defenders were confronted by misogynistic and hyper-patriarchal practices by authorities who perpetuated these ideologies, thus, working ineffectively to end feminicides. Some were inept or even fearful of resolving these crimes, subsequently, exhibiting a dereliction of duty by failing to keep accurate data-keeping files (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Driver, 2015; Bejarano, 2023).\nFeminist activists, digital activists, activist-scholars, and everyday people world-wide are vigorously working to engage in data-keeping mobilizations to document and protest feminicides and gender-based violence. These data-keeping resistance movements collect data to contest the intersectional violence that authorities create and foment. Feminist data projects galvanize record-keeping efforts to maintain and even recover data and make visible the extent of gender-based violence in communities across the Global South and Global North. There are several prominent feminist data projects documenting gender-based violence in existence across the Americas. These projects primarily focus on data that is counting feminicides from specific BIPOC women’s groups or regions, and visualizing these crimes through spreadsheets, repositories, and other forms of digital visualizations such as maps and infographics. Collectively, the data from these projects have served the anti-feminicide movement as tools to counter the erasure or minimization of feminicides that authorities will often claim. Of these nine data projects listed below, we will discuss the first three listed in detail, as they are digital public-facing projects that focus on cases of gender-violence and feminicide in Cd. Juarez. Digital projects like Ellas Tienen Nombre and Ecos del Desierto and archival collections like the Ester Cano Chavez Collection are powerful examples of how civil society organizations, everyday people, and families take the responsibility of collecting this feminist data and doing the work of the authorities. They provide transparency and an unofficial record of data with the use of digital technologies and collaborative practices with professionals in libraries and archival studies, visual studies, geographical information systems, web developers, and other allies. Thus, these types of resources provide a digital record with critical data that impacts the lives of many families and serves as a tool to seek justice. (From Fernandez Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\nActivism, whether it stems from academic institutions, art forms, or through other representations, need to be done ethically, especially since feminicides are a global systemic occurrence and not only occur in the U.S./Mexico border cities. Through the “Border Women” course projects, students approached digital tools, data, and the course’s sensitive topics with the intention of not replicating the same colonial research practices referenced and studied as a class as well as using a humanities-based approach to gender violence data. Since some forms of feminicide awareness decenter the focus of gender violence away from the women and girls themselves, it is necessary that students not only read about and discuss the ethics of gender violence data, but also apply these methodologies and confront these ethical questions through creating their own digital projects."

    "text": "COURSE INTRODUCTION\nIn Fall 2023 with the support of the “Responsible Computing Challenge” of the Mozilla Foundation, with the Responsible Datasets in Context Project, the undergraduate course “Border Women Literature and Feminist Cartography” to be revised and be offered to students from Data Science, History, English, Political Science, Spanish and Film and Media Studies from the Honor’s College and the College of Liberal and Fine Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\nThe course was offered as a special topic, interdisciplinary, collaborative and experiment-driven, where students explore and critically analyze a selected group of border women’s literary texts, archival material, oral histories, digital projects with datasets and databases of counterdata (D’Ignazio 2024) that addressed gender-based and related violence and feminicides at the US-Mexico border and other parts of the world. Through a close and distant reading analysis students enhance in the development of multilingual humanities datasets to explore a series of thematical feminist cartographies through transnational, intersectional, antiracist, geographical and historical frameworks. Additionally, students explore various methods and digital tools and software with public datasets to convert these excerpts into a series of informative critical data visualizations.\nThroughout the course, relevant social, historical, cultural readings, digital material, visual aids, interviews and workshops with writers, critics, activists, project creators and data specialists were included to help students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Overall, students engage in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing at the intersection of feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping and data science.\n Image 1.

    "section": "COURSE DATASET FINAL PROJECT",
    "text": "COURSE DATASET FINAL PROJECT\nIn the Final Module—&gt;Atando cabos, students were divided into six teams and were assigned to create a responsible dataset in context under a particular theme discussed in this course. Every team was tasked with a different form of approaching data, thus deciding on a methodology that will work best under the scenario they faced. Throughout this process they encountered several challenges that exposed them work with missing, uncontextualized, wrong data, data in other languages than English, the digital divide, the pre-digital age, lack of information in the digital cultural record, and the need to do field work or work closely with individuals, community members or organizations involved. Additionally, they had great observations of future work that can be done with these datasets or to make this data more accessible in other platforms to better serve those who are advocating for justice in the public and political level, as well as to expand the research on this data of counting feminicides and human rights movements.\n\nDataset #1: Tracing Feminicides in El Paso, Texas Using the Hispanic-American Newspaper Newsbank-Readex Collection\n\nTeam: Jessica Corona (Leader), Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, & Sara Mosher\nProject Link\nDataset description: Since the beginning of society in the United States, stereotypes and representations of women have been created to oppress them. Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n\nDataset #2: Digital and Translated Version of “El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio” Printed Spreadsheet\n\nTeam: Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille\nProject Link\nDataset Description: As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset.\nDataset dissemination: visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n\nDataset #3: Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).\n\nTeam: Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, Kiri Avelar, & Paris Cantu\nProject Link\nDataset Description: The project’s purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were Woman Hollering Creek (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories (1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from Woman Hollering Creek and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in The Mystery of Survival. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters’ experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n\nDataset #4: Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World\n\nTeam: Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla, Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill\nProject Link\nDataset Description: In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected. Though we are still predominantly shining our light on women and gender-based violence, we found other marginalized communities that can have their messages shared. Films like Killers of the Flower Moon showcase violence based on the Osage community and other similar native American communities, and Milk which shows an openly gay politician fighting to break out of the glass ceiling. These films, though show\ndifferent variations and levels of violence, intersectionality of present, it shows the trials these marginalized communities have faced. While engaged in the data collection and analysis we wanted to highlight these stories as well as leave it strictly to gender-based violence toward women. At the end, the dataset evolved and can be defined into four main takeaways/themes: personification of violence, definitions of violence, representation of genre, and missing stories. The first takeaway was the personification of violence; breaking this down into the on-screen, almost jarring reality of the possible glorification, stylization, and informative analysis of violence on screen. Our team felt that many of the films listed on the dataset could be argued and grouped into any one of the said narratives. This allows the audience to further their own definitions of gender violence in film. This does lead to the next takeaway, definitions. Throughout the construction of the dataset, we noticed a common theme with films depicting gender violence and/or having a main plot point be that of gendered violence. Many of the films listed are defined and categorized as “romances”. Films like Urban Cowboy, I, Tonya, and Lolita are all defined as romances; all these films depict graphic scenes of abuse, both physical and mental. Our question as a group is how does depicting and defining this film impact viewers? Are they glorifying? Are they stylizing? Are they informing? Our third takeaway was the cross-representation of genre. The dataset is broad - it includes films, biopics, documentaries, docuseries, horror, historical dramas, science fiction, and many more. We discovered that genre can be a visual but also narrative aid and representation with overall thematic analysis in relation to a film. Many of the films that we listed focused on and outlined meaningful, non-voyeuristic representational work on the issue of violence against women. All the films, across genres, in most ways, were symbolic of violating the heteronormative values of women and other marginalized groups in media; all following the steppingstones of action, resistance, and retribution. The last takeaway was the missing stories that we, as a group, found that were absent after completing the dataset. Again, it is a broad dataset, but there are still not enough individual, personal stories being represented. Many of our films fall under two categories: white, cis-female representation and wide-releases in English-speaking countries. There is a gap in our data that we must be aware of for the future of the dataset. The stories these films captured span from 1918 to the present, but there are still missing stories, missing people who need to be heard through the media of film.\nDataset dissemination: app, visualizations, image analysis, digital repository and digital exhibit\n\nDataset #5: Books and Articles from Mexico and the U.S. Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Jared Pond (Leader), Emily Malloy (Leader), Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, & Ambonnay Rodriguez\nProject Link\nDataset Description: This dataset project was to call attention to feminicide and gender violence in scholarly literature. We wanted to show that these women are remembered and were failed by their society and protectors. To make people uncomfortable enough to understand the seriousness of this topic, and to show that there are people keeping track and those who care. Our dataset tracks information on pieces of scholarly literature primarily from the U.S. and Mexico that relate to femicide and gender violence. This dataset can be used to compare the types of literature and how it is represented across different publishing houses and countries. And the noticeable absence of information from publishing houses in Mexico. Some of our findings include the trait of Chicano, Hispanic, and Mexican authors publishing in areas other than Mexico, leading to the question of how much, and how hard the government and society itself tries to hide this violence. For example, some of the first books touching on these topics like El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra or Cosecha de Mujeres had trouble finding a publisher and had even issues with some editors in charge. Our limitations included: authors not being on the internet, authors being hidden by other authors’ articles by other interpretations, and not being able to fully investigate and read every single piece of literature we listed. We also understand that we did not incorporate as many essays, articles, and books as there are in other databases as well. The next step for this project is to keep expanding on these works in any way possible. Those who work on this dataset may be able to make more connections between the data than we were able to see as their background knowledge is different than ours; or maybe even more resources than we do. We also recognize that we are missing data and possibly have inaccuracies, but it’s clear that femicide has become more apparent globally and is something that nobody should be quiet about.\n\nDataset #6: Murals and Public Monuments Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Nilou Esmaeili (Leader), Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson\nProject Link\nDataset Description: For this final dataset project, as a group we scavenged data pertaining to murals and monuments placed throughout Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, other various cities throughout Mexico, and internationally. The purpose of this dataset is to hopefully bring awareness to how frequently gender-based violence occurs especially in hotspots such as areas around the US-Mexican border, throughout Mexican cities, other countries of more conservative nature, more populated countries, etc… The list can go on, but the point is, that gender-based violence happens worldwide every day whether we witness it or not. Most of the data sources were from social media sites such as Instagram and X (Twitter). We encountered that when scrolling through these applications, there are a lot of bots, inappropriate content, threats, and unrelated posts. It was frustrating because social media is a good source to pull current information and data from, but navigating was annoying. Originally, our purpose would’ve been to create a program (code) to help the team members easily navigate and pick out the data needed throughout the loads of data and posts we go through on articles and social media sites. Unfortunately, it requires more advanced coding skills to create this program because it utilizes AI databases and even creating databases for the AI coding working with this data requires field work to process this data. Student comment: “I encounter having to interact with data in a way I have not even begun learning nor brushed up on in any of my classes. For reasons such as that, I scrapped my program completely and just manually mined data for our project. It would’ve been a nice way to make it easier for not only me and my groupmates, but my other classmates to use.”\nDataset dissemination: mapping, image analysis, digital and 3D exhibits, virtual reality"

    "text": "ABOUT THE DATASET FINAL PROJECT\nAs part of the assigned reading material, students read El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra: Mujeres y Víctimas de Ciudad Juárez by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez). This text was published by Ediciones del Azar A.C. in November of 1999, with 1001 issues distributed and no edited version created after. It was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with the emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This text wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, the group decided to model their project with humanization at the forefront.\n\n\n\nFront page of the book El silencio que la voz de todas\n\n\nImage 8. The front page of the book, El silencio que la de todas quiebra.\nAt the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Unfortunately, the digital copy that is available online as a PDF file does not include the complete spreadsheet. During the class, the professors had students access to a copy of the completed printed spreadsheet.\n\n\n\nMap created by authors mapping all the cases included in the spreadsheet\n\n\nImage 9. A hands-on map created by the authors mapping all the cases included in the spreadsheet. This map is available at the end of El Silencio.\n\n\n\nPart one of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case\n\n\n\n\n\nPart two of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case\n\n\nImage 10 & 11. The spreadsheet included at the end of the book with a total of 137 cases and metadata related to each case.\nThis spreadsheet is only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Currently, there is a scanned version circulating on the internet, but the spreadsheet is not complete, and the printed book is not on sale anymore and it requires a special process to request the book from libraries that have a copy. Therefore, our group was tasked to:\n\nMake this dataset digitally accessible by transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone.\nTranslate this dataset from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data.\nInclude digitized, digital born or digital sources related to the cases documented in this dataset.\n\nThis latter was intended to contribute current information on the web by finding articles and pictures of the victims mentioned to highlight the person rather than the case’s details. Though it was tough to find information on all of the women, the team found a couple links that have been included in the digital dataset. We followed the same categories listed on the original spreadsheet. We also created a different tab for the English version on the same spreadsheet, as we thought it would be the best way to organize the data for side by side comparisons. This was the information translated and included in the digital dataset in Spanish and English, nothing was modified from the original, except some duplicate cases that were altered when formatting the spreadsheet to fit the book format.\nDataset Link: Bilingual Database of El Silencio de la Voz (Copy).xlsx"

    "text": "WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM? WHO COLLECTED IT?\n\nDataset Translation & Digitization\nA group of undergraduate students at the University of Texas at San Antonio digitized and translated the original feminicide dataset provided by El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra as part of Honor’s course, “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” (Fall 2023) taught by Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla and Paulina Hernández-Trejo. This group of undergraduate students were Jasbeth Medrano (Political Science), Carolina Vlaun (English), Judith Ordonez (Film and Media), Alex Sanchez (Computer Science), and Samuel Friedrich (Kinesiology).\n\n\nOriginal Dataset Authors\nThe data came from a dataset that was included at the end of the book, El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra, by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz, who worked together to collect the data and created the dataset and map previously shown in Image 9 and 10. The authors of El Silencio compiled this dataset and published it in 1999. Besides the dataset, El Silencio intentionally humanizes some of the women and girls that are in the dataset through testimonios of their mothers and family members. According to its introduction chapter, El Silencio’s larger objective would not just be the contribution of this ample feminicide dataset, but rather an intimate encounter between the testimonies of the victims’ mothers and the data itself. El Silencio’s authors wanted this encounter to show how these feminicidios imply a larger systemic violence against women, one that we are all accountable for creating in the way we control women.\nThis text does not feature any of the perpetrators or suspects, aligning with its objective of highlighting the lives, not the deaths, of these women and girls. Thus, El Silencio highlights the lives of Erendira, Sagrario, Olga Alicia, Elizabeth, Adriana, Silvia Elena, and Argelia in detail in between the chapters discussing the creation of the dataset. As the authors reiterate, Ciudad Juárez “should be remembered not only for its feminicides, but also for its women who live a common life, perhaps like our own, one like your mother, your sister or your daughter….the victims should never be considered ‘the problem’ or stigmatized for their deaths; the silence, self-censorship, complicity, and negligence are what should outrage and shame us” (6)."

    "text": "WHY WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? HOW IS THE DATA USED?\nOriginally the data was collected under the lack of response from the Mexican authorities, the United States government to take seriously the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua and its surroundings since the early 1900s. Under this situation, the mothers, family members, activists, human rights defender and others have worked individually and collectively to learn best ways to gather information to fight for justice, policy changes and to work on the different cases that have not been solved. In this case, the original spreadsheet of El Silencio was created by the authors of this book, as they were writers and journalists working for local newspapers (_El Diario _and El Norte) in Cd. Juarez where they started to get together to collect the data of missing and murdered cases since 1990 through newspapers reports, government reports and then corroborating with some of the mothers and family members through their testimonios. This spreadsheet was one of the first ones that accounts to the feminicides in Cd. Juarez and its surroundings in the early 90s when these cases started to have national and international attention. This data has been used for legal cases and for further investigation of the cases documented, as well as for other activists and scholars to continue advocating from justice in physical and digital spaces through initiatives that keep track of this counterdata of feminicides (D’Ignazio, 2024). Some examples are:\n\nAccountant and founder of Casa Amiga, Esther Chavez Cano, who collected all the newspapers and documents of cases of feminicides. Part of the collection was donated to Special Collection in New Mexico State University, the rest is in Casa Amiga.\nActivist and professor Julia Monarrez, author of Trama de una Injusticia: Feminicidio Sexual Sistémico en Ciudad Juárez, who has been working on a database with detailed information of cases in the 90s and more recently.\nActivist Ivonne Ramirez, creator of Ellas Tienen Nombre, who worked on a database of feminicides from 1993 to the present and visualized them in a digital map.\n\nFor the “Border Women and Feminist Cartography” (Fall 2023) course, the printed spreadsheet of El Silencio was chosen to be translated into English and was created into a digital spreadsheet with additional information found in the digital record in order for a larger audience to have access to this data in a digital platform and for non-Spanish speakers. The selection to make this spreadsheet created in the 90s in a digital and bilingual format is due to the generational divide since the issues of feminicides in the border region have been happening during an era that other digital tools and technologies were used and in the present there is a need to update these materials with current digital platforms and technologies to advance the processing and accessibility of previous data work done outside of academia or government institutions."

    "section": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?",
    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\nThe data was collected through research in newspapers reporting the cases, testimonios with the mothers and family members, and through, authorities reports and other legal documents. By consulting and researching from various sources, Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez) were putting the data of each case together in order to have a more complete image of each case.\nFor this project, the new data included was through web research to include digital news reports about cases published locally and internationally. Similarly, the translation to English was meticulously done in order to choose the words that best represent the meanings in Spanish considering how activists and those involved in the movement have determine certain words and specification to avoid the dehumanization of these women. With this in mind, any image or article on the internet that reinforced the interpretation of these cases as death bodies, pieces of body or disposable bodies was not included. Thus, the proceed of making this dataset in a digital and bilingual format followed previous research and observations from feminist scholars and human rights defenders to transfer ethical and responsible practices when working with data related to gender violence and feminicides across geopolitical, digital and linguistic borders.\nJasbeth Medrano, the leader overseeing the digitization and translation of the dataset, addresses: “Our second goal was achieved by putting the information on a digital spreadsheet that would make the data accessible to people without a copy of the book. We also wanted to translate the information from Spanish to English to ensure we could reach a larger audience. Each of these parts required a particular level of care and ethics, especially when translating. For example, there were certain abbreviations in the original dataset that my group assumed for the purpose of transcribing (i.e., my group assumed that “p. Negro” was referring to “pelo negro”, which we translated as “black hair”). We were also careful to not translate geographical locations, such as street names, because translating these points would result in inaccurate information (i.e. choosing to keep “Calle Oro” vs. “Gold Street”). In addition, we chose to place certain information in the same cell to make the spreadsheet easier to read, though this was done with careful consideration and group approval. These were only some of the aspects my team had to navigate through when constructing aspects of the data set, all of which we may have not considered had we not taken this course.” (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)"

    "text": "WHAT DATA IS MISSING? HOW IS UNCERTAINTY HANDLED?\nFrom the original spreadsheet, there is missing and non-identified data in the cases due to how the cases were handled by authorities where intersectional data violence was present by those in charge of the cases (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025). Nevertheless, the authors of this spreadsheet made plenty of efforts to include the most accurate and humanized data from each case, especially by bringing to their methodology the testimonios of the mother and other family members.\nThrough the process of making this spreadsheet a digital and translated dataset version, the project members realized that most of these cases are not registered nor processed in the digital record, which makes us question what would be the best practices and methods in incorporating them? The cases that are present in the digital record are most current ones where digital activism has been involved through hashtags and posts. The ones that are present from the early 90s are the ones that became internationally known and several news reports still circulate on the web."

    "section": "CONCLUSION",
    "text": "CONCLUSION\nThrough the intersection of data science and digital humanities through a transnational and transborder gender perspective, students in this course studied, cogitated, and reflected upon relevant digital, social, historical, cultural readings and works. One of the goals of this course was to aid students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Through the course’s readings and projects, students engaged hands-on in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing within feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping, and data science. The intersection between these lines of work is important and necessary because it prevents the continual “[hard-coding of] sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination into the digital infrastructure of our societies” (D’Ignazio & Klein 2020).\nAs Jasbeth Medrano articulated about their Dataset #2 analysis in the forthcoming article, “The Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities,” this course emphasized the importance of ethics, especially within her team’s methodology. She reflects that she valued the emphasis on ethics the course’s humanistic approaches to data from the most. Rather than being solely graded for the end product/project, the course prioritized student reflections throughout the process. Since the course taught students about the importance of leading each step with “careful consideration and intentionality,” Medrano and her team were able to apply many of these skills to their final dataset project. Lastly, Medrano reflects that it is “dire that future researchers investigate topics with humanistic approaches that stress working with communities, rather than working on them to avoid further harming individuals.”\nThrough Medrano’s reflections, we are able to trace a rich history. Starting with the authors who compiled and published _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra’s _dataset, we see “careful consideration and intentionality” in ensuring that the victims are portrayed as humanely as possible with an intentional feminist approach. These datasets do not cast blame on the victims or their families, but rather the authorities that let this happen. Through the translation and digitization of this dataset, the work of these original authors can be expounded upon and further developed. Many students spoke about using machine learning to create other forms of analysis, while considering the ethical implications of using these technologies.\nWhen weaving together Medrano and her team’s reflections and analyses, it is evident that the course provided a safe learning environment to cultivate their projects’ processes. Through the first five modules, students could freely explore and expand on their preferred digital tools and methodologies, which came into play during this final dataset project. Through these initial modules, students also constantly exercised and applied their understanding of ethics when converging these sensitive topics with their digital processes. As instructors, Fernández and Hernández-Trejo also expanded their own digital humanities pedagogy as well, making this a reciprocal experience for many in this course."

    "section": "TO DO",
    "text": "TO DO\nThere are many ways that this dataset can be and should be expanded upon. We encourage further inquiry using this translated and digitized dataset for future projects related to transnational feminism, decolonial methodologies, and researching examples of grassroots counterdata. Some of the possible further explorations include using machine learning to find more information on the cases with missing data, which would further center the victims’ lives versus her cause of death. Information could include her achievements, her work, and her everyday life as a woman.\nAdditionally, these types of courses are very urgent and necessary in higher education as it prepares students to foster caring, ethical and responsible practices using, analyzing and designing technologies using data of violence issues that the world has been facing throughout centuries. In this course, we noticed that much of the sources were counterdata of gender violence and femincidies still exist in analog formats or in public spaces showing the need to foster solidarity initiatives that can work to digitize, digitally process, preserve and have accessibility protocols towards newspapers, letters, documents, photographs, artifacts, testimonios that hold a very valuable memory. Similarly, it is crucial to keep advocating for multilingual and translingual digital humanities and integrate materials and sources from different parts of the world in order to move out of the comfort zone and expose students to realistic research scenarios where data is multilingual (not just in English) and not easily accessible/legible.\n# 🚧 Under Construction 🚧"
