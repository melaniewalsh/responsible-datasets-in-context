People go to the national parks for a lot of reasons. While many are there for recreation, some travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a national park on all sides). Because of this, the NPS defines “Recreation Visits” as visits made by people who are not:\n\nusing park territory, roads, and facilities for their own convenience or as a part of their occupation. &gt; Reportable non-recreation visits include:\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that the counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we’ll discuss more below)"

    "text": "Data and data collection\nSo now we know what is being collected. But let’s try to understand how it’s being collected. We can do this, in part, by exploring and visualising the data.\nFor example: let’s visualise the visits to Crater Lakes National Park, from 1979 to the present:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which lets us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Crater Lake National Park\ncrater_lake &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Crater Lake NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = crater_lake) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[1]) +\n  labs(title = \"Crater Lake National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a lot of things in this data - not least of which is a tremendous rise in visitors in the 2010s - but one interesting observation is the sudden drop in visits in 2012. This isn’t caused by fewer people visiting: instead, it has more to do with how visitor numbers are counted.\nWhen it comes to counting visitors, the NPS uses a variety of techniques. At some parks, such as Alcatraz, it is simple: the park is only accessible via (ticketed) boat, and so NPS staff simply count the number of tickets. But other parks may have multiple entrances, and feature visitors arriving via car, bus, or on foot. It quickly becomes impractical to have staff at every entrance, 24 hours a day, just in case someone arrives.\nInstead, the NPS uses a variety of techniques - some automated, some manual. These include:\n\nInduction loop counters - magnetised coils of wire under the road that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them;\nTraffic counters, which manually increment a…\nExtracting data from ticketing machines;\n\nAlongside all of that, NPS rangers do, on many occasions, manually count people who arrive - particularly when one of the usual mechanisms doesn’t count. And that’s exactly what happened here; according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances simply broke in January, and wasn’t repaired for (at a minimum) several months. You can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears visits entirely tail off in 2020, as a result of the traffic counter being broken for years:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits, color = cb_palette[2])) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")"

    "text": "Data and reality\nChanges in data don’t only stem from changes in data collection, but also the underlying reality of what is being measured. Let’s take a look at the visitor data from Kobuk Valley National Park:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Kobuk Valley National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[3]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people’s eyes will immediately be drawn to the drastic drop in 2014-15, and for good reason! But the cause is familiar: it’s about data collection. As the park report notes, “https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Monthly%20Visitation%20Comments%20By%20Park?Park=MORA”.\nBut another question would be: why the drop-off in 2018-19? It’s too early for the cause to be COVID. Instead, the cause is administrative; government shut-downs in that era led to a reduction of funding, and correspondingly the closure of various attractions at the park. The result: a lack of funding leads to a reduced visitor count - a visitor count that is often used, remember, to argue for funding. This highlights one of the ways in which seemingly-descriptive data used to make decisions can represent the state of those decisions, more than some natural “baseline”.\nAnother kind of issue of “representing reality” can be found if we look at the visitor data for Mount Rainier:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nrainier_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Mount Rainier NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = rainier_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[4]) +\n  labs(title = \"Mount Rainier National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, we see both a COVID-19 dropoff - but also a continued dropoff beyond that. Looking at the visitation comments explains why; flooding, fires and a blizzard drastically impeded the ability of people to get to the park, and the possibility of areas of the park opening at all."

    "text": "Compensating for data\nAs all of this should suggest, NPS data is always somewhat approximate. Reductions in funding, damage to counting equipment, natural events, or simply the inevitably-fallible nature of any data collection means that data requires a certain amount of prediction, guesswork and massaging to look complete.\nSometimes this leads to odd-looking decisions. For example: at Assateague Island National Seashore, there are two entrances (one in Maryland, and one in Virginia). At both entrances, they use a traffic counter to count vehicles. At both entrances, they get from vehicles to visitors by multiplying the number of vehicles by an estimate of how many people each vehicle contains. But at the Maryland entrance, that’s 2.9. At the Virginia entrance, it’s 3.2"
