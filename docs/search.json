    "text": "History\nThe National Park Service actually began recording information about park visits in 1904 (more than 100 years ago!). However, at this time, their visit collection methods were mostly informal, inconsistent, and low-tech. But over the next century, the NPS worked hard to make their data collection methods more reliable, consistent, and (in some but not all cases) high-tech.\nA big catalyst for the NPS getting serious about data collection was a new law. In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed a federal law that was very important for the NPS and for anybody who loves the outdoors: The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources (i.e. to buying up land and water so that condo developers couldn’t do it first) and building up outdoor recreation infrastructure in the U.S.\nOne of the clauses in this act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each recreation area should be “proportional to visitor use.” Because the NPS can’t function without money, they buckled down on counting visitor use. According to the NPS, over the next twenty years, they “developed and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.”\nWhile today’s visit data collection system is far more formal and sophisticated than the one that the NPS used in 1904, there are still many inconsistencies, flaws, and limitations in this system. These shortcomings are largely unavoidable. Trying to record every single visit to a National Park — across dozens of different parks and geographic regions, many decades of time, countless different weather conditions and funding situations, and hundreds of millions of people — is pretty much impossible. In fact, one of the reasons that this dataset is so useful and illuminating is because it does a good job of communicating an important point: data can never reflect reality precisely.\nHowever, the NPS visitation data also does a good job of communicating why we might be interested in collecting and analyzing even flawed and approximate data, as we will dig into below."

Who collected it?\nThis National Park visitation data was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, a specific program tasked with coordinating visitor statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members were also involved in the data collection process for individual parks, as we will elaborate below.\nThe original data was made available through the NPS Visitor Use Statistics data portal. Through this portal, you can generate reports and download data for many different park visitation categories and time periods— at both the national and individual park levels.\nTo download the data included here, we selected the “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)” report type. We then selected only National Parks; all possible years (1979-2022); all possible regions; only “Recreation Visits”; the additional fields of “State” and “Region”; as well as the option of an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts). We then downloaded this report as a CSV and published it to GitHub for easier access."

    "text": "Why was the data collected? How is the data used?\nAs we’ve already discussed, one of the reasons that the NPS collects visit data is because the government basically requires it. But there are a lot of other reasons that the NPS collects this information.\nAs the NPS writes on their website, they use visit data to determine which facilities might need more or less attention, which parks might need more or less staff members and programs, and which hiking trails or bathrooms might need more or less maintenance. This information also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best share and support resources in a given area — services like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. If there are millions more people going on hikes in a particular area, and thus, inevitably, many more people requiring ambulance trips or rescue helicopters, that would be a very important thing for a community to know. It would be dangerous if visitors to National Parks suddenly and unexpectedly called all the emergency vehicles in town.\nThis visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact, economic and otherwise, that the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large. These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, attention, and collaboration.\n\nThe data can also be used for a variety of other purposes…. (such as?)"

People go to the national parks for a lot of reasons. While many are there for recreation, some travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a national park on all sides). Because of this, the NPS defines “Recreation Visits” as visits made by people who are not:\n\nusing park territory, roads, and facilities for their own convenience or as a part of their occupation. &gt; Reportable non-recreation visits include:\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that the counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we’ll discuss more below)"

    "text": "Data and data collection\nSo now we know what is being collected. But let’s try to understand how it’s being collected. We can do this, in part, by exploring and visualising the data.\nFor example: let’s visualise the visits to Crater Lakes National Park, from 1979 to the present:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Crater Lake National Park\ncrater_lake &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Crater Lake NP\")\n\n# Visualize it\nggplot(data = crater_lake) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = \n  Year, y = RecreationVisits), \n  color = cb_palette[1]) +\n  labs(title = \"Crater Lake National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a lot of things in this data - not least of which is a tremendous rise in visitors in the 2010s - but one interesting observation is the sudden drop in visits in 2012. This isn’t caused by fewer people visiting: instead, it has more to do with how visitor numbers are counted.\nWhen it comes to counting visitors, the NPS uses a variety of techniques. At some parks, such as Alcatraz, it is simple: the park is only accessible via (ticketed) boat, and so NPS staff simply count the number of tickets. But other parks may have multiple entrances, and feature visitors arriving via car, bus, or on foot. It quickly becomes impractical to have staff at every entrance, 24 hours a day, just in case someone arrives.\nInstead, the NPS uses a variety of techniques - some automated, some manual. These include:\n\nInduction loop counters - magnetised coils of wire under the road that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them;\nTraffic counters, which manually increment a counter when a vehicle passes through a gate;\nExtracting data from ticketing machines.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop installed under a road\n\n\nAlongside all of that, NPS rangers do, on many occasions, manually count people who arrive - particularly when one of the usual mechanisms doesn’t count. And that’s exactly what happened here; according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances simply broke in January, and wasn’t repaired for (at a minimum) several months. You can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears visits entirely tail off in 2020, as a result of the traffic counter being broken for years:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")"

Let’s take a look at the visitor data from Kobuk Valley National Park:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Kobuk Valley National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[3]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people’s eyes will immediately be drawn to the drastic drop in 2014-15, and for good reason! But the cause is familiar: it’s about data collection. As the park report notes, ” The park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.“.\nBut another question would be: why the drop-off in 2018-19? It’s too early for the cause to be COVID. Instead, the cause is administrative; government shut-downs in that era led to a reduction of funding, and correspondingly the closure of various attractions at the park. The result: a lack of funding leads to a reduced visitor count - a visitor count that is often used, remember, to argue for funding. This highlights one of the ways in which seemingly-descriptive data used to make decisions can represent the state of those decisions, more than some natural “baseline”.\nAnother kind of issue of “representing reality” can be found if we look at the visitor data for Mount Rainier:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nrainier_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Mount Rainier NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = rainier_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[4]) +\n  labs(title = \"Mount Rainier National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, we see both a COVID-19 dropoff - but also a continued dropoff beyond that. Looking at the visitation comments explains why; flooding, fires and a blizzard drastically impeded the ability of people to get to the park, and the possibility of areas of the park opening at all."

Reductions in funding, damage to counting equipment, natural events, or simply the inevitably-fallible nature of any data collection means that data requires a certain amount of prediction, guesswork and massaging to look complete.\nSometimes this leads to odd-looking decisions. For example: at Assateague Island National Seashore, there are two entrances (one in Maryland, and one in Virginia). At both entrances, they use a traffic counter to count vehicles. At both entrances, they get from vehicles to visitors by multiplying the number of vehicles by an estimate of how many people each vehicle contains. But at the Maryland entrance, that’s 2.9. At the Virginia entrance, it’s 3.2."

Reductions in funding, damage to counting equipment, natural events, or simply the inevitably-fallible nature of any data collection means that data requires a certain amount of prediction, guesswork and massaging to look complete.\nSometimes this leads to odd-looking decisions. For example: at Assateague Island National Seashore, there are two entrances (one in Maryland, and one in Virginia). At both entrances, they use a traffic counter to count vehicles. At both entrances, they get from vehicles to visitors by multiplying the number of vehicles by an estimate of how many people each vehicle contains. But at the Maryland entrance, that’s 2.9. At the Virginia entrance, it’s 3.2. We will talk about that more in our second exercise."

You’ll see, with most of the parks, that one possible report covers “Visitor Use Counting Procedures”. Open it, and look at how the NPS calculates visitors for that park; if you do this with multiple parks, you can see the (often-unexplained) variations between different parks’ procedures."

The NPS also collects visitation data for other park units, such as national battlfieds, national rivers, and national monuments. However, information about other park units is not included in this particular dataset.\n\n\n\nCode\n/*Inputs.table(search, data)*/\n\nInputs.table(search, {\n  layout: \"fixed\",\n  rows: 10,\n  sort: \"Year\",\n  reverse: true,\n  format: {\n    /*RecreationVisits: x =&gt; d3.format('.2s')(x),*/\n    Year: x =&gt; d3.timeFormat(x),\n    RecreationVisits: x =&gt; html`&lt;div style='background:${color(x)}'&gt;${d3.format('.2s')(x)}&lt;/div&gt;`\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis particular dataset is drawn from data published by the NPS. Most (but not all) of the contextual information included here draws from material published by the NPS, as well. However, the original data is made available in an NPS data portal that is relatively hard to find, and its documentation is scattered across many different web pages, which is why we believe it is valuable to curate and publish it in a single place here.\nThis dataset was curated and published by Melanie Walsh, and the data essay was written by Os Keyes and Melanie Walsh.\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service actually began recording information about park visits in 1904 (more than 100 years ago!). However, at this time, their visit collection methods were mostly informal, inconsistent, and low-tech. But over the next century, the NPS worked hard to make their data collection methods more reliable, consistent, and (in some but not all cases) high-tech.\nA big catalyst for the NPS getting serious about data collection was a new law. In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed a federal law that was very important for the NPS and for anybody who loves the outdoors: The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources (i.e. to buying up land and water so that condo developers couldn’t do it first) and building up outdoor recreation infrastructure in the U.S.\nOne of the clauses in this act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each recreation area should be “proportional to visitor use.” Because the NPS can’t function without money, they buckled down on counting visitor use. According to the NPS, over the next twenty years, they “developed and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.”\nWhile today’s visit data collection system is far more formal and sophisticated than the one that the NPS used in 1904, there are still many inconsistencies, flaws, and limitations in this system. These shortcomings are largely unavoidable. Trying to record every single visit to a National Park — across dozens of different parks and geographic regions, many decades of time, countless different weather conditions and funding situations, and hundreds of millions of people — is pretty much impossible. In fact, one of the reasons that this dataset is so useful and illuminating is because it does a good job of communicating an important point: data can never reflect reality precisely.\nHowever, the NPS visitation data also does a good job of communicating why we might be interested in collecting and analyzing even flawed and approximate data, as we will dig into below.\n\n\n\nThis National Park visitation data was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, a specific program tasked with coordinating visitor statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members were also involved in the data collection process for individual parks, as we will elaborate below.\nThe original data was made available through the NPS Visitor Use Statistics data portal. Through this portal, you can generate reports and download data for many different park visitation categories and time periods— at both the national and individual park levels.\nTo download the data included here, we selected the “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)” report type. We then selected only National Parks; all possible years (1979-2022); all possible regions; only “Recreation Visits”; the additional fields of “State” and “Region”; as well as the option of an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts). We then downloaded this report as a CSV and published it to GitHub for easier access.\n\n\n\n\nAs we’ve already discussed, one of the reasons that the NPS collects visit data is because the government basically requires it. But there are a lot of other reasons that the NPS collects this information.\nAs the NPS writes on their website, they use visit data to determine which facilities might need more or less attention, which parks might need more or less staff members and programs, and which hiking trails or bathrooms might need more or less maintenance. This information also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best share and support resources in a given area — services like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. If there are millions more people going on hikes in a particular area, and thus, inevitably, many more people requiring ambulance trips or rescue helicopters, that would be a very important thing for a community to know. It would be dangerous if visitors to National Parks suddenly and unexpectedly called all the emergency vehicles in town.\nThis visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact, economic and otherwise, that the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large. These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, attention, and collaboration.\n\nThe data can also be used for a variety of other purposes…. (such as?)\n\n\n\nIf we open the dataset and look at the first few rows, we will find five columns – “ParkName”, “Region”, “State”, “Year”, and “RecreationVisits”:\n\n\nCode\n# https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/\n\n# Load the dplyr package\nlibrary(dplyr, warn = FALSE)\n\n# Load National Park Visitation data\nnp_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/1979-2020-National-Park-Visits-By-State.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n## Look at the structure of the dataset\nnp_data %&gt;% slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nKatmai NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1995\n0\n\n\nWind Cave NP\nMidwest\nSD\n1994\n871061\n\n\nDeath Valley NP\nPacific West\nCA\n2014\n1101312\n\n\nBiscayne NP\nSoutheast\nFL\n1989\n589957\n\n\nSequoia NP\nPacific West\nCA\n1993\n1066552\n\n\nDry Tortugas NP\nSoutheast\nFL\n2003\n74741\n\n\nBig Bend NP\nIntermountain\nTX\n2008\n362512\n\n\nGuadalupe Mountains NP\nIntermountain\nTX\n1999\n219591\n\n\nBiscayne NP\nSoutheast\nFL\n2020\n402770\n\n\nMount Rainier NP\nPacific West\nWA\n2003\n1262351\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first four are self-explanatory: but why is the fifth labelled “RecreationVisits” rather than “Visits”, or “Visitors”?\nThe answer is that what this dataset is tracking is more complicated and nuanced than “people who go to NPS properties”. People go to the national parks for a lot of reasons. While many are there for recreation, some travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a national park on all sides). Because of this, the NPS defines “Recreation Visits” as visits made by people who are not:\n\nusing park territory, roads, and facilities for their own convenience or as a part of their occupation. &gt; Reportable non-recreation visits include:\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that the counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we’ll discuss more below)\n\n\n\nSo now we know what is being collected. But let’s try to understand how it’s being collected. We can do this, in part, by exploring and visualising the data.\nFor example: let’s visualise the visits to Crater Lakes National Park, from 1979 to the present:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Crater Lake National Park\ncrater_lake &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Crater Lake NP\")\n\n# Visualize it\nggplot(data = crater_lake) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = \n  Year, y = RecreationVisits), \n  color = cb_palette[1]) +\n  labs(title = \"Crater Lake National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a lot of things in this data - not least of which is a tremendous rise in visitors in the 2010s - but one interesting observation is the sudden drop in visits in 2012. This isn’t caused by fewer people visiting: instead, it has more to do with how visitor numbers are counted.\nWhen it comes to counting visitors, the NPS uses a variety of techniques. At some parks, such as Alcatraz, it is simple: the park is only accessible via (ticketed) boat, and so NPS staff simply count the number of tickets. But other parks may have multiple entrances, and feature visitors arriving via car, bus, or on foot. It quickly becomes impractical to have staff at every entrance, 24 hours a day, just in case someone arrives.\nInstead, the NPS uses a variety of techniques - some automated, some manual. These include:\n\nInduction loop counters - magnetised coils of wire under the road that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them;\nTraffic counters, which manually increment a counter when a vehicle passes through a gate;\nExtracting data from ticketing machines.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop installed under a road\n\n\nAlongside all of that, NPS rangers do, on many occasions, manually count people who arrive - particularly when one of the usual mechanisms doesn’t count. And that’s exactly what happened here; according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances simply broke in January, and wasn’t repaired for (at a minimum) several months. You can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears visits entirely tail off in 2020, as a result of the traffic counter being broken for years:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve talked about how data is collected (and the fragility of some of those methods), it’s a good time to think about how even the same method, deployed at different places, might be differently unreliable. For more, see Exercise 1.\n\n\n\nChanges in data don’t only stem from changes in data collection, but also the underlying reality of what is being measured. Let’s take a look at the visitor data from Kobuk Valley National Park:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Kobuk Valley National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[3]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people’s eyes will immediately be drawn to the drastic drop in 2014-15, and for good reason! But the cause is familiar: it’s about data collection. As the park report notes, ” The park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.“.\nBut another question would be: why the drop-off in 2018-19? It’s too early for the cause to be COVID. Instead, the cause is administrative; government shut-downs in that era led to a reduction of funding, and correspondingly the closure of various attractions at the park. The result: a lack of funding leads to a reduced visitor count - a visitor count that is often used, remember, to argue for funding. This highlights one of the ways in which seemingly-descriptive data used to make decisions can represent the state of those decisions, more than some natural “baseline”.\nAnother kind of issue of “representing reality” can be found if we look at the visitor data for Mount Rainier:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nrainier_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Mount Rainier NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = rainier_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[4]) +\n  labs(title = \"Mount Rainier National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, we see both a COVID-19 dropoff - but also a continued dropoff beyond that. Looking at the visitation comments explains why; flooding, fires and a blizzard drastically impeded the ability of people to get to the park, and the possibility of areas of the park opening at all.\n\n\n\nAs all of this should suggest, NPS data is always somewhat approximate. Reductions in funding, damage to counting equipment, natural events, or simply the inevitably-fallible nature of any data collection means that data requires a certain amount of prediction, guesswork and massaging to look complete.\nSometimes this leads to odd-looking decisions. For example: at Assateague Island National Seashore, there are two entrances (one in Maryland, and one in Virginia). At both entrances, they use a traffic counter to count vehicles. At both entrances, they get from vehicles to visitors by multiplying the number of vehicles by an estimate of how many people each vehicle contains. But at the Maryland entrance, that’s 2.9. At the Virginia entrance, it’s 3.2. We will talk about that more in our second exercise.\n\n\n\nAs well as multiplying up, there’s also counting down: some parks register “zero” as the number of visitors they attracted in a year:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to just zeros\nzero_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(RecreationVisits == 0)\n\n# Show some of them\nslice_sample(.data = zero_data, n = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nNational Park of American Samoa\nPacific West\nAS\n2003\n0\n\n\nKatmai NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1995\n0\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2014\n0\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2015\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the parks and regions, we can maybe infer why; they are all in extremely rural or underresourced areas, and probably see few visitors to begin with. If we look at the visitors over time for one park that has “zero counts”, Kobuk Valley National park, we see it’s hardly overrun with people even when the count isn’t zero:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[6]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the visitation comments again, what we see is that “The park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.” Which is entirely reasonable, in isolation: but we’ve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that have new systems developed and choose to (for example) average previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited. What are the politics of the choices in these scenarios?\n\n\n\nReader note: in this exercise, users will try to use public data - twitter posts, flickr photos, etc, etc - to try and find situations where people are identifying themselves as being at a park that, officially, has 0 people present at that time Have them go through public data and try to find proof the counts of 0 are “wrong”\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof search = Inputs.search(data, {\n  placeholder: \"Search\"\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata = d3.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/1979-2022-National-Park-Visits-By-State.csv\", d3.autoType)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfiltered = data.filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min &lt; penguin.bill_length_mm &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncolor = d3\n  .scaleLinear()\n  .domain([5000000, 1000000, 100000])\n  .range([\"#cafcc2\", \"#fce7c2\", \"#eb9494\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n/*Inputs.table(search, data)*/\n\nInputs.table(search, {\n  layout: \"fixed\",\n  rows: 50,\n  sort: \"Year\",\n  reverse: true,\n  format: {\n    /*RecreationVisits: x =&gt; d3.format('.2s')(x),*/\n    Year: x =&gt; d3.timeFormat(x),\n    RecreationVisits: x =&gt; html`&lt;div style='background:${color(x)}'&gt;${d3.format('.2s')(x)}&lt;/div&gt;`\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRPython\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nCategories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 26, 2024\n\n\nIntroduction to DPLYR with National Park Visitation Data (Solution)\n\n\ndplyr, solution\n\n\n\n\nFeb 26, 2024\n\n\nggplot Customization with National Park Visitation Data (Solution)\n\n\nggplot, advanced, solution\n\n\n\n\nFeb 26, 2024\n\n\nIntroduction to DPLYR with National Park Visitation Data (Exercise)\n\n\ndplyr, exercise, solution\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices breaking is inevitable - but as the different scales of the Carlsbad and Crater Lake outages indicate, they get fixed at different rates, in different locations. There are a lot of reasons for this, but some of the big ones might be geography and resources. The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it—and the less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritised by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nThinking about this, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn “compensating for data”, we talked about how the NPS fills in missing data or approximates data with uncertain values (such as the number of people per car). This is necessary work, but it’s also under-explained work in the examples we used - and it goes far beyond those examples.\nTo see this in action, take a look at the NPS page that documents park reports and select a park. You’ll see, with most of the parks, that one possible report covers “Visitor Use Counting Procedures”. Open it, and look at how the NPS calculates visitors for that park; if you do this with multiple parks, you can see the (often-unexplained) variations between different parks’ procedures."

    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\nThe very first National Park — Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming — was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. A handful of other parks — Sequoia, Yosemite, Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake — joined the system in the next several decades. While the National Parks were originally created to protect precious, beautiful lands and to make them accessible to the public — a noble goal — it’s important to remember that these lands were taken, often forcibly, from Native American people who already owned, lived, and worked on them (Beauchamp 2020). Today, there are still calls for the NPS to return the lands of the National Parks to Indigenous people.\nScholars have similarly shown that early conservation movements, which spurred the development of the National Parks, were troublingly intertwined with racism and eugenics movements (Beauchamp 2020). These prejudiced origins, combined with continuing forms of environmental racism, have contributed to the marginalization of people of color and other minorities in the parks — in other words, research has shown that white people visit the parks much more than other demographic groups(Weber and Sultana 2013; Alba et al. 2022; Floyd and Johnson 2002). The National Parks are not equally accessible to everyone in the same way, and these exclusions shape the park visitation data even before it’s counted.\nVisit counting, according to the NPS, started a long time ago — as early as 1904 (more than 10 years before the National Park Service itself was officially created). However, at this time, their data collection methods were mostly “informal,” inconsistent, and low-tech. But over the next century, the NPS worked hard to make their methods more reliable, consistent, and (in some but not all cases) technologically advanced.\nA big catalyst for the NPS getting serious about data collection was a new law. In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources (i.e. to buying up more land and water so that condo developers couldn’t do it first) and to expanding outdoor recreation infrastructure in the U.S.\nBecause this act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each area should be “proportional to visitor use,” the NPS buckled down on counting visitor use. Over the next twenty years, they accordingly “developed and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.”\nWhile today’s National Park data collection system is more formal and sophisticated than the one that the NPS used in 1904, there are still many inconsistencies, flaws, and limitations in this system. And these shortcomings are largely unavoidable. Trying to record every single visit to a National Park — across dozens of different parks and geographic regions; many decades of time; countless changing weather conditions; a great deal of economic and financial fluctuation; and hundreds of millions of people — is pretty much impossible. We believe this data is useful to study, in fact, because it helps demonstrate that data never reflects reality precisely.\nHowever, the National Park visit data also demonstrates why collecting and analyzing data, even if it is flawed and approximate, is sometimes worthwhile — if you fully understand the data’s flaws, limitations, and history, and if you incorporate these considerations into all subsequent analyses, interpretations, and takeaways."

    "text": "Where did the data come from? Who collected it?\nThe National Park data on this website was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, a specific program tasked with coordinating visitor statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members across all 63 parks were also involved in the data collection process.\nThe original data was made available through the NPS’s Visitor Use Statistics data portal. Through this portal, you can generate reports and download data for many different park visitation categories and time periods — at both national and individual park levels. To download the data included here, we first selected “National Reports” in the data portal, and we then selected the “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)” report type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Selections for National Park visit data generated with “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)”\n\n\n\nFor “Park Types,” we selected only “National Parks”; for “Years,” we selected all possible years (1979-2023); for “Regions,” we selected all possible regions; for “Field Type,” we selected only “Recreation Visits” (excluding “NonRecreation Visits,”” “Recreation Hours,” “NonRecreation Hours,” “Concessioner Lodging,” “Concessioner Camping,” “Tent Campers,” “RV Campers,” “Backcountry Campers,” “NonRecreation Overnight Stays,” and “Miscellaneous Overnight Stays”); for “Additional Fields,” we selected “State” and “Region”. We also selected the option of viewing the report as an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts).\nIf you choose to download this report as a CSV file, it will unfortunately not look exactly like the report pictured in Figure 1; instead, the CSV will include all visit and use types, and it will include visit/use information by month rather than aggregated by year. When I have compiled this data to share with my students in the past, I have sometimes downloaded the CSV file and then removed the columns that I’m not interested in and aggregated the data by year programatically. In other cases, I have simply copied and pasted the annual summary report into a CSV file.\nIn either case, it is usually necessary to explicitly transform the format of the “RecreationVisits” column into a number and to remove the commas that separate the numbers by thousands (a transformation that you can do with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets or with a programming language) Finally, we published the data to this project’s GitHub repository for easier storage and access."

    "text": "Why was the data collected? How is the data used?\nThe NPS collects visit data partly because the government requires it, as we’ve already discussed. But the NPS also uses the visit data for other internal purposes — to determine which parks need more staff members and programming, which hiking trails need more maintenance, or which visitor centers need more bathrooms.\nThe visit data also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best provide and share resources, like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. If millions more hikers started to come to Mt. Rainier, for example, that would be a very important thing for the surrounding community to know. To consider just one consequence of this increase, those hikers would likely need more ambulance trips and rescue helicopters, and you wouldn’t want visitors to the local National Park booking up all the emergency vehicles in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 2021 report on NPS economic impact // Graphic by NPS\n\n\n\nThe visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact—economic and otherwise—that the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large (Figure 2). These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, and attention.\nThe data is also frequently reported on by journalists, who use it to highlight the most popular parks and noteworthy visitation records, as well as to point their readers to parks where they might be able to find some peace and quiet (see articles in Thrillist, Smithsonian, and CNN)."

    "text": "What’s in the data? What “counts” as a visit?\nNow that we know how the data is used, let’s dive into the data itself. What’s actually in this dataset, and what “counts” as a visit?\nTo get started, let’s load the dataset and examine a random sample of rows.\n\n\nCode\n# https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/\n\n# Load the dplyr package\nlibrary(dplyr, warn = FALSE)\n\n# Load National Park Visitation data\nnp_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://github.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context/raw/main/datasets/national-parks/US-National-Parks_RecreationVisits_1979-2023.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n## Look at the structure of the dataset, randomly sample 10 rows\nnp_data %&gt;% slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nZion NP\nIntermountain\nUT\n1990\n2102400\n\n\nKatmai NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1983\n11182\n\n\nGreat Basin NP\nPacific West\nNV\n2003\n87020\n\n\nVirgin Islands NP\nSoutheast\nVI\n2019\n133398\n\n\nEverglades NP\nSoutheast\nFL\n2013\n1047116\n\n\nRocky Mountain NP\nIntermountain\nCO\n1990\n2647323\n\n\nDry Tortugas NP\nSoutheast\nFL\n1986\n15379\n\n\nVoyageurs NP\nMidwest\nMN\n2012\n214841\n\n\nZion NP\nIntermountain\nUT\n1982\n1246290\n\n\nGuadalupe Mountains NP\nIntermountain\nTX\n2001\n222307\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see five columns – “ParkName”, “Region”, “State”, “Year”, and “RecreationVisits.” The first four are pretty self-explanatory, but why is the fifth labelled “RecreationVisits” rather than “Visits” or “Visitors”?\nIt turns out that the NPS distinguishes between kinds of visits to their parks. There are “recreation” visits — when people are visiting the parks for fun, vacation, exercise, etc. — and there are “non-recreation” visits — when people are visiting the parks for other reasons. For example, some people need to travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through the park, or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a National Park on all sides). Other people are visiting the parks because they have actual business to conduct in the parks.\nHere’s a full list of “reportable non-recreation” visitsaccording to the NPS:\n\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nWhat this means is that “recreation visit” counts leave out a lot of people. This is worth thinking about when we evaluate what the numbers mean, and how the NPS achieves them (which we’ll discuss more below).\nIt also means that they’re not counting individual people. This data doesn’t tell us anything about the people who are visiting.\n(Note: The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota is located inside Badlands National Park (the visitor center is on the reservation), which could be worth discussing here.)"

    "text": "Data and data collection\nSo now we know what is being collected. But let’s try to understand how it’s being collected. We can do this, in part, by exploring and visualising the data.\nFor example: let’s visualise the visits to Crater Lakes National Park, from 1979 to the present:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes.

This isn’t caused by fewer people visiting: instead, it has more to do with how visitor numbers are counted.\nWhen it comes to counting visitors, the NPS uses a variety of techniques. At some parks, such as Alcatraz, it is simple: the park is only accessible via (ticketed) boat, and so NPS staff simply count the number of tickets. But other parks may have multiple entrances, and feature visitors arriving via car, bus, or on foot. It quickly becomes impractical to have staff at every entrance, 24 hours a day, just in case someone arrives.\nInstead, the NPS uses a variety of techniques - some automated, some manual. These include:\n\nInduction loop counters - magnetised coils of wire under the road that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them;\nTraffic counters, which manually increment a counter when a vehicle passes through a gate;\nExtracting data from ticketing machines.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop installed under a road\n\n\nAlongside all of that, NPS rangers do, on many occasions, manually count people who arrive - particularly when one of the usual mechanisms doesn’t count. And that’s exactly what happened here; according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances simply broke in January, and wasn’t repaired for (at a minimum) several months. You can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears visits entirely tail off in 2020, as a result of the traffic counter being broken for years:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")"

If we look at the visitors over time for one park that has “zero counts”, Kobuk Valley National park, we see it’s hardly overrun with people even when the count isn’t zero:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[6]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the visitation comments again, what we see is that “The park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.” Which is entirely reasonable, in isolation: but we’ve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that have new systems developed and choose to (for example) average previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited. What are the politics of the choices in these scenarios?"

The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why?

    "text": "How was the data collected?\nSo how does the NPS actually count these recreation visits? Take a moment and see if you come up with a few guesses…\nIt turns out that each park counts visits differently. And at many parks, each entrance at each park even counts visits differently.\nIf you go to the “Park Reports” tab in the NPS Data Portal, you can look up an individual park and download a PDF file called “Visitor Use Counting Procedures,” which details exactly what procedures they use to count visits at this park. Most of the parks have several PDFs because their counting procedures have changed many times over the years!\nTo count visits, most parks use a combination of automatic traffic counters and manual counting—that is, staff members who use their eyeballs to literally count the number of people arriving by foot, bike, bus, cross-country skis, snowmobile, boat, canoe, etc. Perhaps most interesting, they usually take those counts and then apply a specifically designed mathematical formula to arrive at the most accurate estimate of number of recreation visits — adding, subtracting, and multiplying the counts based on a variety of factors, such as the season or the entrance (e.g. assuming that more people would likely be arriving in a car in the summer months at the most popular gate than in the winter months at the least popular gate) or how many non-recreation visits they expect are a confounding factor.\nThis browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: &lt;a href=\"Everglades_Visitor-Use-Counting-Procedures_2023.pdf\"&gt;Download PDF&lt;/a&gt;{fig-alt=“Everglades”}\nFor example, at Everglades National Park, at the Shark Valley Entrance, there is a pneumatic tube traffic counter that counts the number of cars that pass over it. The staff members then apply different mathematical operations to this number in order to arrive at what they think is the most accurate estimate of recreation visits:\n\nThe traffic count is divided by 2 to account for entry and exit. The adjusted traffic count is reduced by the number of buses, the number of bicycles counted when the entrance station is open, 127 bicycles per month to account for after-hours use, and by 200 non-recreation vehicles per month October through May and 100 non-recreation vehicles per month June through September. The traffic count is further reduced by 350 non-reportable (NPS) vehicles per month. The reduced count is multiplied by 2.17 persons per vehicle.\n\nWhat’s more, the devices that the NPS uses to count visits, like pneumatic tube counters or induction loop counters (magnetised coils of wire that are installed under a road, and that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them) sometimes break.\n\n\n\nAn example of a pneumatic tube traffic counter, installed above the road\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an induction loop, installed beneath a road (making it harder to detect when it breaks!)\n\n\nFor example, according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances at Crater Lakes National Park broke in 2012 and wasn’t repaired for (at a minimum) several months:\n\n2/1/2012 | The Traffic Counter at Annie Springs Entrance Station was not functioning properly and therefore we have a count of zero.\n\n\n3/1/2012 | Broken counter at Annie Springs Entrance, unable to record numbers.\n\n\n4/1/2012 | Traffic counter was broken for the beginning of the month and may have low numbers.\n\n\n10/1/2012 | Counts estimated by Butch\n\n\n11/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n12/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n1/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\n\n2/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\nYou can see a similar, but more severe, example at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where it appears that visits have been declining since around 2019:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) + \n  labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decline may, in part, be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut the NPS logs also show that the main induction loop counter at Carlsbad Caverns broke in 2019 and has remained broken for years:\n\n9/1/2019 | Traffic counter apparently has been broken since July. Traffic counts are estimated.\n\n\n4/1/2020 | Main road traffic counter is broken, I have estimated the count.\n\n\n12/1/2020 | Corona virus closure that began in November ended on December 4th. Main road traffic counter remains broken.Possible problem with Loop Road counter.\n\n\n4/1/2022 Main road traffic counter remains broken. Rattlesnake Springs traffic counter seems to be off, I will henceforth provide estimates.\n\n\n9/1/2023 | Loop Road and backcountry closed due to flood damage. Slaughter Canyon Cave remains closed Traffic counter on main road remains broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve talked about how data is collected (and the fragility of some of those methods), it’s a good time to think about how even the same method, deployed at different places, might be differently unreliable. For more, see Activity 1."

This hard number makes it seem conclusive, as if there really were no people people who stepped onto the park lands in those years.\nIn 2015, John Quinley, the Alaska regional spokesperson for the NPS, spoke with the Anchorage Daily News about this issue, and he admitted that “it might have been better if park statisticians had put something other than a zero in the visitor box for 2014 — say maybe a question mark.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nWhy would you or wouldn’t you want to record a question mark in this dataset? What else could you use to record uncertainty?\n\n\nThe decision not to record visits in certain years seems reasonable on its face, but we’ve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that, when faced with a similar situation, chose to provide an estimate for a certain year based on average counts from previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited. This matters because, as we’ve discussed, there are financial, political, and social ramifications for these visit count numbers.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Kobuk Valley National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits ), color = cb_palette[3]) +\n  labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s possible that we can see some of these ramifications in other time periods in the Kobuk Valley visit data. If you look at the years 2018 and 2019, for example, you will notice a distinct drop in visits from the previous years. This drop may be the result of the federal government shutdown that took place in December 2018 — the longest government shutdown in history, which lasted for 35 days. The Kobuk Valley logs report that the visitor center was closed for almost that entire time, because they weren’t receiving government funding:\n\n12/1/2018 | The Kotzebue Visitor Center was close from Dec. 22 - Dec. 31 2018 due to lapse in government appropriations.\n\n\n1/1/2019 | Kotzebue Visitor Center was closed due to lapse in federal appropriations from January 1, 2019 to January 27, 2019. The Visitor Center re-opened January 28, 2019.\n\nBut since visit count numbers are commonly used to advocate for more government funding and more support, we can see that there might be a vicious cycle at play here. It’s possible that parks with lower funding and support will have lower visit counts for those reasons, making it even harder for them to advocate for what they need."
