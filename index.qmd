This website contains a repository of curated datasets that are paired with rich documentation, related essays, and teaching resources. 

We dig into the **social and historical context** of each dataset, and we provide extensive documentation about the data's **provenance and limitations**. We also include teaching resources for each datasetâ€”such as **programming exercises**, **discussion questions**, **lessons plans**, and moreâ€”to enable their seamless integration into the classroom.

By providing these contextual materials, we hope to promote the responsible use of these particular datasets for teaching, research, and general exploration. We also seek to promote the responsible use of data more broadlyâ€”whether in the classroom, industry, or the wider worldâ€”by underscoring the significance of context in all data-related work.
