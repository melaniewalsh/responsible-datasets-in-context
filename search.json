    "text": "Our Data Essays\nThe general structure of our data essays are inspired by Heather Krause’s concept of a data biography.\nA data essay will and should differ depending on the data it describes, but most of our data essays try to address the following questions:\n\nWhat is the historical context of the data?\nWhere did the data come from? Who collected it?\nWhy was the data collected?\nHow was the data collected?\nHow is the data used?\nWhat’s in the data?\nWhat “counts” as a data point?\nWhat data is missing?\nHow is uncertainty handled?"

    "section": "Our Data Principles",
    "text": "Our Data Principles\nBased on our work and conversations, we also offer the following principles to help guide ethically responsible dataset curation, consumption, and analysis:\n\nTell the Data’s Story / Know the Data’s Story\nAs scholars like Johanna Drucker and others have been arguing for more than a decade, data is not simply objectively “there” in the world. Datasets have human-oriented stories behind them and implicit within them, and the stories of how and why data was created ought to be integrally connected to the datasets themselves.\nWhat are the constraints of the source material? What material might be simply absent from the historical record, and how do those absences shape what data we can effectively construct? Also, where are there elements of uncertainty or fuzziness in the data? If choices had to be made regarding, for instance, the dating of a creative work, how were those choices made, and why?\n\n\nProvide Metadata / Understand Metadata\nMetadata is often overlooked. But understanding what each data point and feature represents is fundamental to ethically responsible data work, so it is important to gives users a way to access and understand that metadata. Which categories were deemed important to catalog and measure, and which were excluded? If gender is an aspect of metadata, is gender only available under binarized categories? Is race included or discussed – and why?\n\n\nTouch Every Data Point\nFor creators and users of datasets, it is important to actually explore and try out datasets to make sure they’re accurate and glitch-free, and that they represent what we think they represent—in other words, it is important to actually open a dataset in Excel, Google Sheets, etc., and examine individual cells. When data is too large for these kinds of applications, it is important to examine individual data points in other ways. This is a basic yet surprisingly radical concept! It is especially important when we use automated processes to create datasets, like web scraping, which are also more likely to distance us from individual data points.\n\n\nConsider When Data Should Remain Off-Limits or Private\nThere is a growing movement in data science to think carefully about who can ethically access certain kinds of data. Representations of tribal rituals among indigenous communities are often only meant for members of those communities, so accessing photographs or other sorts of quantitative data about that traditional knowledge should probably be restricted. Projects like Mukurtu have specifically addressed this issue and developed platforms where communities can choose who they share their data with.\nSimilarly, the editors of sites like the Colored Conventions Project have argued that data about enslaved people and their descendents has historically “served in the processes and recording of the destruction and devaluation of Black lives and communities.” They maintain that there is an urgent need to affirm “the Black humanity inherent in Black data/curation.” In other words, when data is about real people who may have been marginalized or oppressed, it is important that those people be named and recognized."

    "text": "When NPS Visit Data Became Political\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Credit: SFGATE. Yosemite’s High Sierra webcam at 12:25 p.m., March 1, 2025. Screenshot via National Park Service.\n\n\n\nThe context and significance of the National Park visit data shifted radically in early 2025. In March, the National Park Service was told to keep quiet about the previous year’s visit data, according to an internal memo shared by Resistance Rangers. There would be no public communications rollout about visit numbers, as there had been in the past. This is especially surprising because 2024 was a record year. With more than 331 total million visits, more people had visited NPS sites than ever. Why would the NPS be told to keep quiet about their most popular year ever?\n\n\nCode\nviewof all_park_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps because President Donald Trump and his administration are actively trying to gut the NPS. In February 2025, Trump fired ~1,000 NPS employees (and has since hired back only a few of them despite two court orders) and also moved to close visitor centers and other facilities. When asked why the NPS would choose not to share their 2024 visit numbers, former National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis told SFGATE:\n\nThe suppression of this data would not be coming from anyone in the NPS, which proudly displays the numbers every year (just look back at the last 20 years!). This decision would be forced on NPS by the DOI politicals or DOGE, worried about the high visitation numbers, the economic value, and the bad press coming from firing so many NPS employees.\n\nIn addition to mass firings and closures, the Trump administration also pressured NPS to remove references to transgender people across its web pages and sites, even at the memorial for the Stonewall Riots where transgender people played integral roles. \nIn this essay, we emphasize that data is always approximate and imperfect, that it is shaped, inevitably, by human beings and their choices. In light of the Trump administration’s attempted dismantling of the National Parks, it is worth underscoring that this NPS visit data is incredibly powerful, political, valuable, and carefully documented. This data proves how many people love the National Parks. And it proves that data can help us advocate for the institutions and communities that we care about most."

    "text": "History\nA national park is an area of land that a country’s government deems important enough to officially protect, preserve, and make available to the public. There are thousands of national parks around the world (some of which are featured in the Netflix documentary, “Our Great National Parks,” narrated by former President Barack Obama).\nIn the United States, the very first National Park—Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming—was signed into law in 1872 by President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lone Star Geyser, one of the whopping ~500 geysers at Yellowstone National Park. Photo credit: NPS/Neal Herbert.\n\n\n\nOver the next several decades, a handful of other parks—such as Sequoia (1890), Yosemite (1890), Mount Rainier (1899), and Crater Lake (1902)—joined the system, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most recent National Park?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recently added National Park is New River Gorge National Park in West Virginia. It was designated in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mount Rainier, also known by the Indigenous name Tahoma, is an active volcano and 14,411 feet tall. Mount Rainier National Park, which is 60 miles south-east of Seattle, Washington, was founded in 1899. Photo credit: NPS (public domain).\n\n\n\nWhile the National Parks were originally created to protect precious, beautiful lands and to make them accessible to everyday people—a noble goal—it is important to remember that many of these lands were taken, sometimes forcibly, from Native American people who already owned, lived, and worked on them (Spence 2000; Beauchamp 2020). Today, there are still calls for the NPS to return the lands of the National Parks to Indigenous people.\nIn a similar vein, scholars have shown that early environmental conservation movements—movements that helped to spur the development of the National Parks—were troublingly intertwined with racism and eugenics movements (Beauchamp 2020). These prejudiced origins, combined with continuing forms of environmental racism (e.g., many parks are located far from cities, with limited public transporation options and limited community outreach), have contributed to the marginalization of people of color and other minorities in the parks. Research has shown that white people visit the parks more than other racial groups (Weber and Sultana 2013; Alba et al. 2022; Floyd and Johnson 2002). So while the National Parks are technically open to everyone, they are not equally accessible to everyone in the same way. And these exclusions shape the parks’ visitation data even before it’s counted.\nSo when and why did visit counting start at the U.S. National Parks? Well, according to the NPS, the counting of park visits started as early as 1904 (more than 10 years before the National Park Service itself was officially created). But at this time, and for the next 50 years or so, their data collection methods were mostly informal, inconsistent, and low-tech.\n\nBut in 1965, the NPS started getting serious about counting visits. That year, the U.S. Congress passed The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This act created a new source of government money specifically dedicated to protecting natural resources and expanding outdoor recreation infrastructure. Because the act stipulated that the amount of money allocated to each area should be “proportional to visitor use,” the NPS buckled down on counting visitor use. They “developed and institutionalized a formal system for collecting, compiling and reporting visitor use data.”\nIn 1979, the NPS comprehensively changed their counting procedure, and all parks began tracking visitor use by month (as opposed to year) across 11 different statistics. This is why the datasets featured here begin in 1979.1 Note: We aggregated monthly counts into yearly counts for the dataset featured in this essay. A dataset with visit counts by month is available in “Explore the Data.”\n\n\nCode\n# Note on installation: https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/\n\n# Load the dplyr package for data manipulation\n# Load the ggplot2 package for data visualization\n# Load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes.

This data does not represent the exact number of people who visited the parks in the last 50 years. Think about how difficult it would be to count every single one of the millions of people who walked, hiked, backpacked, drove, shuttled, canoed, biked, or skied into each of the 63 different parks since 1979. These parks are located in dozens of different geographic areas, including mountains, volcanoes, deserts, canyons, wetlands, forests, and islands; the parks have experienced countless different weather conditions during this time, including blizzards, hurricanes, wildfires, avalanches, and extreme heat; and the parks have also been allocated varying amounts of money and staff members to do the counting. Given all this variability, it is simply not possible to count every single visit to every single National Park ever.\nWe believe the National Park visit data is useful to study and consider precisely for this reason: because it helps demonstrate that data never reflects reality precisely. But it also demonstrates that collecting and analyzing data, even when it is flawed and approximate, can be worthwhile and even powerful—but only if you fully understand the data’s flaws, limitations, and history, and only if you incorporate these considerations into all subsequent analyses, interpretations, and takeaways."

    "text": "Where did the data come from? Who collected it?\nThe National Park data on this website was originally organized and published by the NPS Social Science Program, which in turn runs the NPS Visitor Use Statistics program, an initiative that coordinates visitor use statistics across the parks. Thousands of staff members across all 63 parks were also involved in the data collection process.\nAccording to the NPS, the Visitor Use Statistics program aims to:\n\n\nProvide a statistically valid, reliable, and uniform method of collecting and reporting visitor use data for each independent unit administered by the NPS\nSupport regular collection, and timely publication, analysis and interpretation of these data\nEnact quality control checks, verify measurements, and ensure consistency and comparability of data among areas of the NPS\n\n\nWe accessed the original data through the NPS’s Visitor Use Statistics data portal, which publishes visit use data in alignment with the program’s stated goals. Through this portal, anyone can generate reports and download data for different visit use categories and time periods—at both national and individual park levels.\nTo download the data included here, we first selected “National Reports” in the data portal, and we then selected the “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)” report type. Here are the selections we made:\n\nFor “Park Types,” we selected only “National Parks.”\nFor “Years,” we selected all possible years (1979-2023).\nFor “Regions,” we selected all possible regions.\nFor “Field Type,” we selected only “Recreation Visits” (excluding the other 10 possible statistics: “NonRecreation Visits,” “Recreation Hours,” “NonRecreation Hours,” “Concessioner Lodging,” “Concessioner Camping,” “Tent Campers,” “RV Campers,” “Backcountry Campers,” “NonRecreation Overnight Stays,” and “Miscellaneous Overnight Stays”).\nFor “Additional Fields,” we selected “State” and “Region.”\nWe also selected the option of viewing the report as an annual summary of visit counts (as opposed to monthly visit counts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Selections for National Park visit data generated with “Query Builder for Public Use Statistics (1979 - Last Calendar Year)”.\n\n\n\nIf you choose to download this report as a CSV file, it will unfortunately not look exactly like the report pictured in Figure 4; instead, the CSV will include all visit and use types, and it will include visit and use information by month rather than by year. When I (Melanie Walsh) have compiled this data to share with my students in the past, I have sometimes downloaded the CSV file, removed the columns that I’m not interested in, and aggregated the data by year programatically. In other cases, I have simply copied and pasted the annual summary report into a CSV file.\nIn either case, it is usually necessary to explicitly transform the format of the “RecreationVisits” column into a number and to remove the commas that separate the numbers by thousands (a transformation that you can do with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets, or with a programming language like Python or R). Finally, we published the data to this project’s GitHub repository for easier storage and access."

    "text": "Why was the data collected? How is the data used?\nThe NPS collects visit data partly because the government requires it, as we’ve already discussed. But the NPS also uses the visit data for other internal purposes—to help determine which parks might need more staff members and programming, which hiking trails might need more maintenance, which natural areas might need more protection, or which visitor centers might need more bathrooms.\nThe visit data also helps the communities and businesses surrounding the parks understand how they can best provide and share resources, like emergency vehicles, sanitation, and water. For example, if there’s been a large influx of hikers to Mount Rainier National Park in recent years, that would be an important thing for the surrounding community to know. Because those hikers would probably need more ambulance trips and rescue helicopters (unfortunately but inevitably), and the surrounding towns wouldn’t want visitors to the National Park booking up all the available emergency vehicles in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 2021 report on NPS economic impact. Graphic credit: NPS.\n\n\n\nThe visitation data also helps the NPS estimate the beneficial impact—economic and otherwise—that the parks have on nearby communities and the nation at large (Figure 5). For example, in 2021, an NPS report showed that “4.5 million visitors to Grand Canyon National Park…spent an estimated $710 million in gateway regions near the park,” which “supported 9,390 jobs in the local area.” These estimations are important because they help the parks advocate for more funding, support, and attention.\nThe data is also frequently reported on by journalists, who use it to highlight the most popular parks and noteworthy visitation records, and to point their readers to parks where they might be able to find some peace and quiet (see articles in Thrillist, Smithsonian, and CNN).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Question 1\n\n\n\nHow else might the National Park visit data be used? How might it be used by artists, historians, literary scholars, sociologists, or librarians?\nFor more, see Discussion Q 1."

First, there are reportable and non-reportable visits. When NPS employees or their families go to the parks, these visits are non-reportable. But pretty much everything else is reportable. Within reportable visits, there are two more types of visits: recreation and non-recreation visits. Recreation visits are when people are visiting the parks for fun, vacation, exercise, school trips, etc., and non-recreation visits are when people are visiting the parks for other reasons. For example, some people need to travel through the parks, either because a highway runs through the park, or because they live on “inholdings” (private property that is surrounded by a National Park on all sides). Other people need to visit the parks because they have business to conduct.\nHere’s a full list of the “reportable non-recreation” visits, according to the NPS:\n\n\nPersons going to and from inholdings across significant parts of park land;\nCommuter and other traffic using NPS-administered roads or waterways through a park for their convenience;\nTrades-people with business in the park;\nAny civilian activity a part of or incidental to the pursuit of a gainful occupation (e.g., guides);\nGovernment personnel (other than NPS employees) with business in the park;\nCitizens using NPS buildings for civic or local government business, or attending public hearings;\nOutside research activities (visits and overnights) if independent of NPS legislated interests (e.g. meteorological research).\n\n\nCarefully reviewing this list reveals that the term “recreation visit” excludes a significant number of visits and individuals. It also raises important questions about how the NPS distinguishes between different types of visits, which we will explore further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Question 2\n\n\n\nWhat are the potential consequences of considering these visits to be non-recreation vs. recreation visits?\nFor more, see Discussion Q 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Badlands National Park sign, gesturing to the South Unit’s co-management between the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the NPS. Photo credit: NPS.\n\n\n\nThe list also prompts us to consider those whose presence in the parks doesn’t fit neatly into the “visit” category at all. For instance, a portion of Badlands National Park in South Dakota overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is “owned by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and managed by the National Park Service under an agreement with the Tribe.” According to the NPS, when traveling through this area, visitors might encounter “signs of religious worship” from Tribal members, such as “prayer sticks” or pieces of “brightly colored fabric tied to a shrub,” and they are advised to “respect [the Tribal members’] beliefs and practices and leave these objects.” These symbols woven into the landscape underscore that members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are not visitors to the Badlands but stewards and residents with deep ancestral connections. It reveals that the National Park data’s focus on “visits”—–whether reportable or non-reportable, recreational or non-recreational—–fails to account for those who are not visitors, those who own and live on the land, and those whose ancestors lived on the land before the NPS even existed."

    "text": "How was the data collected?\nAt this point, we know what counts as visit, but how does the NPS actually count these visits and collect data? And how do they differentiate between the different types of visits? Take a moment and see if you come up with a few guesses.\nIt turns out that each park counts visits differently. At many parks, each entrance at each park even counts visits differently.\nIf you go to the “Park Reports” tab in the NPS Data Portal, you can look up an individual park and download a PDF file called “Visitor Use Counting Procedures,” which details exactly what procedures they use to count visits at this park. Most of the parks have several PDFs because their counting procedures have changed many times over the years!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2\n\n\n\nHow are the procedures for three different parks similar or different? For more, see Activity 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: An example of a pneumatic tube traffic counter, installed above the road.\n\n\n\nTo count visits, most parks use a combination of automatic traffic counters and manual counting–—that is, staff members who use their eyeballs to literally count the number of people arriving by foot, bike, bus, cross-country skis, snowmobile, boat, canoe, etc.\nWhether automatic or manual, these counts are usually modified with specially designed mathematical formulas, which are supposed to produce the most accurate estimate for recreation visits at any given location. Staff members add, subtract, multiply, and divide the counts based on a variety of factors, such as the season or the entrance (e.g. assuming that more people would likely be arriving in a car in the summer months at the most popular gate than in the winter months at the least popular gate).\n\n\n\nTable 1 from “VOYAGEURS NATIONAL PARK PUBLIC USE REPORTING AND COUNTING INSTRUCTIONS.” Find the document here: https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park.\n\n\nFor instance, in the summer months (May through November) at Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota—a park dominated by lakes and waterways—they estimate visits by taking the number of visits to visitor centers, and then adding the estimated number of fishermen, houseboaters, and backcountry overnight stays. To take just one of these categories as an example, they estimate the number of fishermen by “taking the sum of the visitor center counts and applying the regression equation in Table 1,” which is displayed above. In August, that number would be (-1.06) * VISITOR CENTER COUNTS  +  37,021. However, if the month is November, and if the visitor count exceeds 17,00, “then fishermen are estimated at 0.” These detailed instructions point to the countless decisions and methodological choices that underlie the National Park visit data. These manipulations are arguably necessary to achieve “statistically valid, reliable, and uniform” collection methods and data, as is the program’s goal, but they also reveal the ever persistent gap between recorded data and reality.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Voyageurs National Park\nvoyageurs_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Voyageurs NP\")\n\n# Visualizee it\nggplot(data = voyageurs_data) +\n    geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[8]) +\n    labs(title = \"Voyageurs National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\") +\n    # abbreviate numbers by millions and thousands\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider, next, Everglades National Park in Florida. At the Shark Valley Entrance, there is a pneumatic tube traffic counter (Figure 7) that counts the number of cars that pass over it. The Everglades NP staff members then apply different mathematical operations to this number in order to arrive at what they think is the most accurate estimate of recreation visits:\nThis browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: &lt;a href=\"other_docs/Everglades_Visitor-Use-Counting-Procedures_2023.pdf\"&gt;Download PDF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe traffic count is divided by 2 to account for entry and exit. The adjusted traffic count is reduced by the number of buses, the number of bicycles counted when the entrance station is open, 127 bicycles per month to account for after-hours use, and by 200 non-recreation vehicles per month October through May and 100 non-recreation vehicles per month June through September. The traffic count is further reduced by 350 non-reportable (NPS) vehicles per month. The reduced count is multiplied by 2.17 persons per vehicle.\n\nLike Voyageurs NP in Minnesota, Everglades NP modifies their raw visit data in many ways. Once again, these modifications are arguably necessary, but they are nevertheless extensive and almost certainly subject to debate.\nWhat’s more, the devices that the NPS uses to count visits—such as pneumatic tube counters or induction loop counters (magnetized coils of wire that are installed under a road, and that “trip” when a vehicle passes over them)—sometimes break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: An example of an induction loop, installed beneath a road (making it harder to detect when it breaks!).\n\n\n\nFor example, according to the NPS data logs, the induction loop counter at one of the main entrances at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon broke in 2012 and wasn’t repaired for at least a year:\n\n2/1/2012 | The Traffic Counter at Annie Springs Entrance Station was not functioning properly and therefore we have a count of zero.\n\n\n3/1/2012 | Broken counter at Annie Springs Entrance, unable to record numbers.\n\n\n4/1/2012 | Traffic counter was broken for the beginning of the month and may have low numbers.\n\n\n10/1/2012 | Counts estimated by Butch\n\n\n11/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n12/1/2012 | TRAFFIC COUNT AT ANNIE SPRINGS ENTRANCE NOT AVAILIBLE\n\n\n1/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\n\n2/1/2013 | Traffic count at Annie Springs estimated.\n\nIn some months, the broken counter meant that the number of recorded visits at this entrance was recorded as zero. In other months, park staff—including someone named Butch—decided to estimate the counts.\nYou can see a similar, but more severe, example of a broken counter at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in California, where it appears that visits have had a recent decline since 2019:\n\n\nCode\n# Load the \"ggplot2\" package (which we'll be using a lot more)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Let's also load \"ggthemes\", which let's us use colorblind-compatible palettes. When we've only got one line, this will just be black.\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# And specify the colorblind palette\ncb_palette &lt;- colorblind_pal()(8)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n# Filter down to Carlsbad Caverns National Park\ncarlsbad_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Carlsbad Caverns NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = carlsbad_data) +\n    geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[2]) +\n    labs(title = \"Carlsbad Caverns National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\") +\n    # abbreviate numbers by millions and thousands\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decline may be due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the NPS logs also show that the main induction loop counter at Carlsbad Caverns broke in 2019 and has remained broken for multiple years:\n\n9/1/2019 | Traffic counter apparently has been broken since July. Traffic counts are estimated.\n\n\n4/1/2020 | Main road traffic counter is broken, I have estimated the count.\n\n\n12/1/2020 | Corona virus closure that began in November ended on December 4th. Main road traffic counter remains broken.Possible problem with Loop Road counter.\n\n\n4/1/2022 Main road traffic counter remains broken. Rattlesnake Springs traffic counter seems to be off, I will henceforth provide estimates.\n\n\n9/1/2023 | Loop Road and backcountry closed due to flood damage. Slaughter Canyon Cave remains closed Traffic counter on main road remains broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve talked about how data is collected (and the fragility of some of those methods), it’s a good time to think about how even the same method, deployed at different places, might be differently unreliable.

    "text": "What data is missing? How is uncertainty handled?\nWe already know that there is a lot missing from the National Park visit data. There are people who never make it the parks—and thus never make it into the dataset—because of environmental racism and a history of discrimination and colonialism that is intertwined with the parks. There are people who don’t fit neatly into the category of a visit, such as those who live inside the parks. There are also people who are missed by the parks’ various counting procedures and manipulations.\nWhat else might be missing or uncertain? It turns out that the data itself can point us to some answers. An important step in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to analyze key summary statistics for your data, such as maximum, minimum, or average values. This step can reveal important patterns, problems, or inconsistencies in the data, and point to parts of a dataset’s backstory that need to be researched and understood further. Exploring summary statistics for the National Park data— specifically, minimum values—reveals a few curious outliers that point us to key areas of uncertainty.\nIf you filter the National Park visit data for the parks with the lest (or minimum) number of visits since 1979, you will notice that there are some parks that had zero visits in a given year.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for minimum RecVisits\nleast_visited &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(RecreationVisits == min(RecreationVisits))\n\n# Number of rows for least visited\nnum_rows &lt;- nrow(least_visited)\n\n# Show some of them\nleast_visited %&gt;% slice_sample(n = min(10, num_rows))\n\n\nWarning: 'xfun::attr()' is deprecated.\nUse 'xfun::attr2()' instead.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkName\nRegion\nState\nYear\nRecreationVisits\n\n\n\n\nNational Park of American Samoa\nPacific West\nAS\n2003\n0\n\n\nKatmai NP & PRES\nAlaska\nAK\n1995\n0\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2015\n0\n\n\nKobuk Valley NP\nAlaska\nAK\n2014\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might guess that there are no visits in these years because these parks are all located in remote places, like rural Alaska or American Samoa.\nIf we look at the visitation trends for Kobuk Valley National Park in Alaska, for example, we can see that a couple of years with zero visits isn’t a huge aberration from the trend:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter down to Mount Rainier National Park\nkobuk_data &lt;- np_data %&gt;% filter(ParkName == \"Kobuk Valley NP\")\n\n# Visualise it\nggplot(data = kobuk_data) +\n    geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = RecreationVisits), color = cb_palette[6]) +\n    labs(title = \"Kobuk Valley National Park Visits (1979 - Present)\") +\n    # abbreviate numbers by millions and thousands\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after a little digging, we found out that in 2014 and 2015, Kobuk Valley National Park actually didn’t count visitors at all.\nIf we look at the visitation reports for Kobuk Valley in 2014, they say that “the park is developing a new counting system and has made the decision not to report visitor counts until the new system is in place.” Though they didn’t count visitors at all, they still recorded a zero in those two years. This hard number makes it seem conclusive, like there were truly zero people who stepped onto the park lands in those years.\nIn 2015, John Quinley, the Alaska regional spokesperson for the NPS, spoke with the Anchorage Daily News about this issue, and he admitted that “it might have been better if park statisticians had put something other than a zero in the visitor box for 2014 — say maybe a question mark.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 3\n\n\n\nCan you find evidence of people visiting Kobuk Valley National Park in 2014 and 2015? For more, see Activity 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Question 3\n\n\n\nWhy would you or wouldn’t you want to record a question mark in this dataset? For more, see Discussion Q 3.\n\n\nThe decision not to record visits in certain years seems reasonable on its face, but we’ve also seen a lot of parks in more highly-frequented areas that, when faced with a similar situation, chose to provide an estimate for a certain year based on average counts from previous years, rather than simply declare that nobody visited.\nWhen parks get more visits, they usually get more money, resources, and staff. Once outfitted with more funding, resources, and staff, they can usually attract and support even more visitors. By contrast, a dip in visitation data can potentially lead to a cycle of stagnation or decline. The choice to record zeros for Kobuk Valley NP in 2014 and 2015 was likely made out of a sense of scientific responsibility and integrity. It’s unclear how, if at all, this choice impacted the park. But this example highlights how data collection decisions can have real-world impacts, and how the people making these choices are often aware of these impacts and must weigh trade-offs—not only from a scientific or statistical perspective, but also from a social, economic, political, and even personal perspective."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe NPS’s visitation data is a valuable resource that gives us a glimpse into the country’s relationship with the National Parks—some of the world’s most precious natural resources—over the last 50 years. This data is integral to the maintenance and growth of the parks, to environmental conservation, to gateway communities, and to our historical and sociological understanding. But the National Park visit data, like all data, is also approximate and imperfect. As we have seen, it is collected by imperfect devices, such as traffic counters that are vulnerable to weather or malfunctioning. But even more importantly, it is collected and shaped by people, people who not only count some of the visits manually, but who also decide what counts as a visit, how to count visits (e.g., to use this technology or that formula) and which numbers to record when things don’t go as planned. There are endless interesting, important, and fun analyses that we can do with this visit data, but to really make sense of it in any meaningful way, we need to dig into and consider the people, context, and circumstances that shaped it."

But they will also get fixed at different rates, in different locations, as we could see in the case of Crater Lake National Park (where a counter was fixed quickly) and Carlsbad Caverns National Park (where a broken counter from 2019 still has not been fixed).\nThere are many reasons for these disparities, but some of the big ones might be geography and resources. The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.\nWith this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.\n\n\n\nPark\nPriority (1-5)\nReason\n\n\n\n\nAcadia NP\n\n\n\n\nLassen Volcanic NP\n\n\n\n\nSaguaro NP\n\n\n\n\nYosemite NP\n\n\n\n\nMammoth Cave NP"

The collection currently contains about 1000 poems, all of which are out of copyright in the U.S., with the bulk of the poetry published in fourteen different magazines, including both Black-oriented and edited magazines like The Crisis, Opportunity, and Black Opals as well as ‘mainstream’ (predominantly White) magazines like Survey Graphic, The Liberator, and Palms. The dataset includes information on authors’ biographies, poetic form, topics and themes, the names of editors (including guest editors and co-editors), as well as republication information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief Survey\n\n\n\nIf you use our materials in your class or another setting, we would love to hear about it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport {viewof dataSummaryView, viewof selectedColumns, viewof twobuttons, viewof dataSet, tableContainer, table, tableStyles, viewof tableOptions} from \"d26a73a377141f3c\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntableContainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof twobuttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhtml`&lt;link href='https://unpkg.com/tabulator-tables@5.3.1/dist/css/tabulator.min.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;\ntabulator.min.css`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Summary of Columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof selectedColumns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof dataSummaryView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons License\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n\n\nMagazines were a crucial part of the landscape of literary publishing in the U.S. during the early twentieth century. Magazines with often very large national readerships helped writers find their audience, and opportunities to work as editors help position established writers in positions of power and authority in the American publishing industry.\nThe broader goal is to collect materials from both predominantly Black and predominantly White (or “mainstream”) magazines, to enable researchers to understand the changing shape of African American poetry in and out of the American mainstream. We’ll explain some specific dimensions of the collection we’ve put together below, including how to search and sort through the material. Under a separate tab, we’ll also suggest some possible classroom exercises that might make this collection useful for students who are learning about African American poetry for the first time. However, first we’ll briefly introduce the concept of African American American Periodical Poetry."

    "text": "African American Periodical Poetry: a Bit of Background\nIn their poetry, African American writers argued for Civil Rights, challenged the unjust practices and racialized violence that were prevalent in American life, and worked out new and distinctive aesthetic concepts. At the beginning of the twentieth century, African American poetry was not so much a ‘literary’ movement as it was a part of popular culture, with hugely popular and influential figures like Paul Laurence Dunbar and an important element of African American Vernacular writing and performance linked to the oral tradition (Ramey, A History of African American Poetry, 2019). However, by the 1920s, changes in the style and function of the poetry was evident, and these changes can be readily traced in poetry published in periodicals.\nThe overall conception of this project borrows from Modernist Periodical Studies, led by scholars such as Sean Latham (“The Rise of Periodical Studies,” 2006), Robert Scholes and Clifford Wulfman (Modernism in the Magazines, 2010), and Adam McKible and Suzanne Churchill (Little Magazines and Modernism, 2005). It is also deeply invested in the field that has come to be known as Black Digital Humanities scholarship; we hope our work will be legible as in the vein of Kim Gallon’s “technology of recovery” (“Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities, 2016), where an important goal is to make under-studied materials accessible and legible to a broad readership, including readers outside of academia. Other scholarship that has influenced our own includes the Colored Conventions Project (Foreman, Casey, and Patterson, 2021), and Roopika Risam’s New Digital Worlds(2018). And more generally, we see our work as continuing to fill in a continuing problem of the “Archive Gap,” where minoritized writers often continue to be under-studied and under-curated in major digital collections, with knock-on effects for quantitative analysis based on textual corpora (see Singh, “Beyond the Archive Gap,” 2020)."

    "text": "Why These Particular Periodicals? The Black Press and the Advent of “Crossover” Publications\nWe have attempted to build a comprehensive collection of African American periodical poetry from the early 20th century, arranging it so that visitors to this site can search and sort based on their own research questions. We believe that the creation of this collection will allow both serous scholars as well as students and those new to the field to see the full richness and range of African American poetry from this period in new ways.\nThe Black Press. First and foremost, we believe that in order to understand how African American poetry developed and grew in the years covered by this project, it’s important to engage with the primary venue through which that poetry was published and read – the Black press. For many poets in this Anthology, African American-oriented periodicals were the first destination for poetry. Magazine publication was how Black poets found readers and developed a sense of community, and the collections we have produced for this project hopefully show some powerful emerging networks and conversations about the role of literature in civil rights activism, questions of aesthetics, and questions of language. Also, at least until the mid-1920s, publication in mainstream venues like Poetry or Vanity Fair was extremely rare for African American poets, so venues like The Crisis and Opportunity were often the best way to get published.\nTo be sure, the poetry published by these magazines is of quite varying quality and importance to literary historians. Rather than evaluate or curate the materials based on our particular tastes or preexisting consensus, our aspiration here is to make all of the periodical poetry we can find accessible to readers with the hope that it will be helpful to different kinds of research projects and questions. Putting everything together in one place, as we have attempted to do here, can sometimes reveal alignments and patterns that might not have previously been visible. What might readers discover? What new questions can we ask?\n1900-1920: A somewhat overlooked era in African American poetry. The field of African American periodical poetry was quite active in the first two decades of the 20th century, though many of the magazines where poetry was published were not well-preserved, and are today only available in fragments. Two important magazines from the first decade of the twentieth century that have been been well-preserved and digitized are Voice of the Negro (Atlanta and Chicago, 1904-1907) and Colored American Magazine (Boston and New York, 1900-1908). Both printed a considerable amount of poetry, and we have included a substantial number of poems from these magazines in our current collection. W.E.B. Du Bois also edited two magazines that appeared only briefly in this period, Moon Illustrated Weekly (1905-1906), and Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line (1907-1910). Horizon did not appear to print much in the way of poetry; Moon Illustrated Weekly printed poems only occasionally. Both magazines have only been partially preserved. At present, those magazines are sparsely represented in our collection.\nThe Crisis became a major vehicle for poetry publication starting in 1910, under Du Bois’ editorship. It was an especially important venue for Georgia Douglas Johnson, who published more than 30 poems in the magazine during this period; we also see substantial numbers of poems published by writers like James D. Corrothers, Joseph S. Cotter, and Lucian B. Watkins – writers who were well known at this time, but who subsequently dropped off the critical radar. Du Bois himself published several notable poems in The Crisis during this period, and these poems are included in our collection. One particularly active theme in late 1910s poetry is World War I (see the Glossary in a separate tab for other themes).\nThe 1920s: The Crisis, Opportunity, and The Messenger.  There were three very large and successful African American magazines in the 1920s, all published in New York but with national circulations: The Crisis, Opportunity, and The Messenger. With The Crisis, there appears to have been a steady build-up of interest in poetry through the 1910s, leading up to Jessie Fauset’s taking on the role of literary editor between 1919-1926. With her work at The Crisis, Fauset brought a serious literary sensibility to the magazine and a considerable increase in quality.\nWith regards to Opportunity: as biographers for writers like Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes have documented, the racially-integrated Opportunity “prize” dinners in 1924, 1925, and 1926 seemed to function at least in part as coming out parties for emerging writers, helping to create a sense of excitement about African American poetry both within the Black community and beyond it. White editors and publishers like Paul Kellogg and Horace Liveright attended a particularly important dinner at the Harlem Civic Club in March of 1924, which led to the idea of the special issue devoted to African American writing in Survey Graphic (March 1925), guest-edited by Alain Locke.\nThe mid-1920s as tipping point for African American poetry. As we’ve developed our collection of African American periodical poetry, it’s become clearer and clearer that the mid- and late-1920s was a special moment of growth and recognition. First and foremost, there is the remarkable proliferation of African American general interest magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity, as mentioned above. The same period also saw the emergence of several African American literary magazines, including Fire!! in New York in 1926, Black Opals in Philadelphia in 1927-1928, and Saturday Evening Quill in Boston from 1928-1930. Fire!! ran for only a single issue; Black Opals ran for four issues, and featured many prominent names despite having a fairly tiny print run (250 copies of each issue were printed). Saturday Evening Quill, for its part, was essentially the house magazine for a vibrant African American literary social club active in the late 1920s in Boston. In the present collection, we have collected poems from each of these magazines.\nLast but not least, several mainstream publications open their pages to special issues devoted to African American poetry during this period. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the special March 1925 issue of Survey Graphic guest-edited by Alain Locke, which would become the basis for the hugely influential anthology The New Negro: an Interpretation (1925). There were also special issues dedicated to African American poetry published by modernist little magazines like Palms (guest-edited by Countee Cullen), as well as The Carolina Magazine, which did excellent issues on African American poetry, guest-edited by Lewis Alexander. This growing engagement from the mainstream was also reflected of course in the fact that mainstream commercial publishers in New York and Boston were also publishing significant quantities of African American poetry during this time period. Success in periodical publication often led to book-length poetry collections – Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and James Weldon Johnosn all published book-length collections of poetry with mainstream New York publishers in the subsequent years. (Sadly, writers who were women did not appear to have this same benefit.)\nAlongside the Special Issues described above, Claude McKay published a number of poems, especially in Max Eastman-edited magazine, The Liberator (not to be confused with William Lloyd Garrison’s magazine of the same name from the mid-19th century). McKay is somewhat anomalous in that he published much more outside of the Black press than he did within it (though he is certainly well-represented in The Crisis)."

Who Collected It? \nThe texts that form the basis of the data in this dataset come from a variety of sources, including publicly available resources like HathiTrust and Archive.org. We also relied on the digitized versions of Saturday Evening Quill at the University of Delaware’s library. And a colleague at North Carolina State University, Madhusudan Kutti, was kind enough to send us a digitized copy of the 1926 special issue of Palms we have included in the collection; it was not available elsewhere. Our own work entailed reading the issues, locating poetry published in them, and creating text versions. We also made an effort to describe the poetic form, mark down thematic tags (“Progress and Racial Uplift”; “Motherhood”; etc.). (See the Glossary of Themes and Forms Tab for more)\nThe lead researcher on this project is Amardeep Singh, a professor of English at Lehigh University. He has been creating digital projects related to minoritized writers for several years, beginning with projects like “Claude McKay’s Early Poetry” and “Women of the Early Harlem Renaissance.” Since 2022, he has been developing a larger project called “African American Poetry: A Digital Anthology” (AAPADA), a Scalar project that aims to be a comprehensive collection of poetry by Black writers that is out of copyright. The poems collected for this dataset are also presented in simple text versions on AAPADA.\nKate Hennessey, a Lehigh University graduate student, assisted with the collection of the data as well as the editing and formatting of poems during the spring of 2024. Other Lehigh graduate students have been involved with the project, either as paid graduate research assistants or as students in seminars, whose research and editing skills have at times been added to the project (with full credit and permission). Other recent students who have contributed to the project include Miranda Alvarez Guillen and Christian Farrior. Several of the students involved in the project are people who identify as Black."

    "section": "How might this dataset – and the collection of texts behind it – be used? ",
    "text": "How might this dataset – and the collection of texts behind it – be used? \nThere are any number of ways this collection might be used.\nLiterary Prestige and Canonization. While some poets saw their careers and reputations take off during the peak years of the Harlem Renaissance, other writers were largely left by the wayside. By examining the “Prize-Winning” keyword under “Themes,” users can zoom in on poems and poets who dominated the literary prize contests at magazines like Opportunity and The Crisis starting in the mid-1920s. Another way of exploring the impact of individual poems might be to note poems that were republished in multiple venues (see the column “Second Venue” in the dataset along those lines). The fact that a poem was repeatedly reprinted might be an indication of its literary cachet and social impact.\nGender. Another use might be to study changing gender distributions over the time period at issue. In the early years of the 20th century, poetry published in magazines like Colored American Magazine and Voice of the Negro was overwhelmingly dominated by poets who were men. By the 1920s, there was a significant uptick in poetry by women; how and where this was occurring could be studied in greater detail.\nAnother intriguing question is the role of editors who were women. Jessie Fauset played an important role at The Crisis through the 1910s through the mid-1920s; editors who were women also played important roles at Colored American Magazine (Pauline Hopkins), and Black Opals (Nellie Bright, Gwendolyn Bennett).\nAs of this writing, we are unaware of any African American poets from this period who identified as transgender or non-binary in our collection. If we come to learn more about authors’ gender identity that might lead us to add additional gender identity categories, we will do that.\nPoetic Form. Scholars interested in the evolution of African American poetic forms in the early 20th century might want to explore our Poetic Form column. At the beginning of this period, most published poetry by Black poets was in rhymed, accented verse (often using the Common Measure); following the dominant trend in American poetry in the mid-1920s, there was an explosion of Free Verse in many of the magazines. The collection also contains a large number of African American Sonnets (written throughout the period), as well as experiments with the Blues, Elegies, and a number of other forms.\nThe Impact of Editors and Author-Editors. Editors played a huge role in encouraging African American poets in these various magazines. Some editors were also poets themselves. The poet Countee Cullen was on the masthead as an Associate Editor at Opportunity during the peak of his fame (1927-1928); he also guest-edited a special issue of the little magazine Palms in 1926, which probably informed his subsequent decision to edit the 1927 collection, Caroling Dusk. Jessie Fauset, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Lewis Alexander were all poets who also served as guest-editors or associate editors in various magazines during this period.\nPredominantly Black vs. Predominantly White Publications. We have marked whether the magazines where poems where published were “predominantly White” or “predominantly Black.” In the 1920s in particular, there was a striking increase in the number of predominantly White publications that ran special issues devoted to African American poetry. Some of these were especially high-impact events (especially the special issue of Survey Graphic in March 1925). This too could be studied, especially in connection with other attributes (for instance, one sees that the Survey Graphic special issue mentioned above was especially influential; but the issue is far more lopsided towards poets who were men than one sees in predominantly Black publications from the same time period).\nWhite poets? As magazines like The Crisis and Opportunity became more prominent as national publications in the 1920s, they also had a substantial readership that was White. And with Countee Cullen playing a prominent role as an Associate Editor at Opportunity in 1927-1928, there were quite a few poets who were White publishing in these magazines. At present, we have excluded these writers from the collection. A future version of this project might include White poets who engaged with racial justice issues in the Black press (there were many who did, and their work has not been given much critical attention).\nFrequency of publication and authorial prestige. Poets like Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen published many poems in several different magazines during this period (both predominantly Black and predominantly White magazines). But poets who are less well-known today were also highly prolific – one thinks especially of Georgia Douglas Johnson (who has approximately 50 poems represented in this dataset). However, some writers who published much less went on to have an outsized impact on the basis of relatively few poems – one thinks of Helene Johnson, Mae V. Cowdery, and Arna Bontemps along those lines.\nExploring lesser-known authors. Many poems in the dataset were published by poets who did not aspire to have careers as poets; they may have only published one or two poems. Others (such as Edward S. Silvera and Lewis Alexander) were accomplished poets who were well-known to their peers, but might have dropped off abruptly (Edward Silvera died quite young, at age 31). And there are a few authors who published five or more poems included in this collection about whom we have been able to find nothing (one such name might be Ann Lawrence [also known as Ann Lawrence-Lucas]; she published several thoughtful poems in The Messenger in the mid-1920s)."

In the dataset, sort by Poetic form. Was there an increase in the number of poems tagged as Free Verse poems over time? When did that increase happen, and which magazines really seemed to embrace and encourage it?\nSonnets. One really striking feature of this collection is the prevalence of sonnets. Sonnets are often studied as a form associated with early modern love poetry – one thinks of Shakespeare’s famous Sonnets along those lines. However, it was a form that was hugely popular among African American poets as well, including throughout the early part of the 20th century. Many African American poets adapted the form to align it with social justice themes.\nFirst, sort the dataset by “Form,” and separate the Sonnets (perhaps paste just the poems tagged as Sonnets into a new Google Sheet—there should be about 70 such poems).\nNow, sort again by “Theme,” and pick a Theme that you are especially interested in. (One we might recommend exploring might be “Progress and Racial Uplift”).\nNow, read some of the poems themselves. What patterns do you see?\nNo form – can you find one?

We have also not tagged poems related to romantic love in the collection – there are many!). The general approach we have taken comes from the main African American Poetry: A Digital Anthology website, and a list of some of the prominent thematic tags (as well as an explanation of how we’re defining them) can be found on the “Glossary of Themes and Forms” Tab.\nSort the collection by “Theme,” and explore some of the Themes we have labeled.

    "text": "Historical Events and Tribute Poems\n\nWorld War I. This tag will be especially interesting to readers interested in African American writers responding to World War I, especially in the 1910s. Some writers took a critical eye to how Black soldiers were treated, and the difficulty of mustering patriotic feeling in a society that treated Black folks as second-class citizens. (14 poems with this tag)\nSpanish-American War. Poems dealing with African American soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war, including the Philippine War that followed (mainly 1900-1910).\n\nSlavery. Many of these writers were writing in living memory of the slavery era, and had relatives who had been enslaved. Paul Laurence Dunbar, for instance, was born to parents who had been enslaved. For Black writers in this period, grappling with the legacy of slavery was an important and ongoing topic. (40 poems with this tag)\nLynching and Racialized Violence. Thousands of African American people were brutally murdered in extrajudicial mob killings – lynchings – in this period. This was a topic that was widely covered in the Black press, especially in magazines like The Crisis. A few poems directly address this horrific phenomenon. Under this tag, we also include poems dealing with racialized violence (such as race riots) that might not strictly speaking be understood as lynchings. (30 poems with this tag)\nFrederick Douglass. Tribute poems for Frederick Douglass.\nPaul Laurence Dunbar. Tribute poems for Paul Laurence Dunbar.\nAbraham Lincoln. Poems by Black poets commemorating President Abraham Lincoln.\nCivil War. Poems by Black poets reflecting on the Civil War (1861-1865)."

    "text": "Social and Political Themes\n\nRace. Many, many poems in this collection might be tagged as dealing with race in some way, so over time we have added additional differentiations for two especially important subtopics: “Race: Identity formation” and “Race: Black Beauty.” (100+ poems with some version of this tag)\nRacism. Poems tagged with “racism” deal explicitly with racialized hostility, segregation, and its effects on the African American community.\nProgress and Racial Uplift. Poems thematizing racial progress, uplift, and the civil rights movement. (Approximately 55 poems in the collection are tagged this way)\nQueer and Homoerotic. Poems dealing with same-sex desire or LGBTQIA identities. Several important writers from this period are known from biographical evidence to have been LGBTQIA; here we have tagged only poems that seem to explicitly reflect same-sex or queer desire.\nMotherhood. This is a rich topic, especially for poets from the 1910s. Some of the most memorable poetry thematizing motherhood is written by Georgia Douglas Johnson. (18 poems with this tag)\nInterracial, Multiracial, and Race Relations. Poems dealing with relationships that cross racial borders, including friendships, antagonistic relationships, and romances. We also use this category for poems that reference mixed-race people, such as Georgia Douglas Johnson’s “The Octoroon.” (21 poems with this tag)\nReligion. Poems representing engagement with religion, including both the affirmative embrace of Christianity in the interest of civil rights and more critical engagements.\nLabor. Poems dealing with class and labor relations. (approx. 30 poems with this tag)\nTravel, Migration and Great Migration. This was a period in which many African American writers were on the move, and this tag references poems that deal with travel in Europe or Africa. It is also used for poems dealing with the Great Migration, the massive movement of Black folks from the U.S. south to northern amd midwestern cities that began in the early 1900s and continued through the 1940s. (approx. 28 poems with this tag)\nPatriotism. Poems exploring the often conflicted relationship many African American writers had with questions of patriotism and national pride."

As is well-known, Harlem was the epicenter of the Black cultural community that emerged in the 1920s, and many poets celebrated it in their writing, including Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and many others.\nHBCU. Many Black writers from this period were associated with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in some way. Some – notably Langston Hughes – attended HBCUs and received degrees there. Others, including Alain Locke, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charles Johnson, and Zora Neale Hurston, taught at HBCUs. There are many references to universities like Fisk University, Howard University, Atlanta University, and so on in the poetry of this period.\nAfrica. Poems that thematize Africa in some way. Imagining Africa was an important theme for many Black poets in the early 20th century – both those involved with the UNIA and Garveyism and more broadly. Africa was especially vivid to Langston Hughes, as he had a memorable visit to West Africa early in his career.\n\nCaribbean. Writers like Claude McKay and Eric Walrond had direct Caribbean connections, and often wrote about it in their works. But others – especially Langston Hughes – also engaged the Caribbean in their writing. The Caribbean was also important to Arthur Schomburg, who immigrated to the U.S. from Puerto Rico in 1891."

Claude McKay famously used sonnets in many of his most influential political poems. Writers like Georgia Douglas Johnson and Carrie Williams Clifford also found the sonnet form appealing, again, in connection with social justice-oriented poetry. (approx. 75 poems with this tag)\nVarious other poetic forms: Common Measure, Villanelle, Terza Rima, Elegy, Ode, Haiku, Ballad, Free Verse, Blues\nPrize-winning poems. Poems that won one of the poetry prize competitions from the mid-1920s, sponsored by either The Crisis or Opportunity magazine. (32 poems with this tag)\nMusic. The emphasis on music in poems by Langston Hughes is well-known, but in fact many Black poets from this period were interested in the connections between music and lyricism.\nIntertextual. Poems that allude to other authors, including white authors.\nBlack Vernacular (AAVE). Poems using AAVE. There were active debates at the time among Black poets about the use of language that was sometimes seen as caricaturing Black voices.\nPoetry for children. Many well-known African American writers of this period wrote poems for children on occasion, including especially Langston Hughes and Jessie Fauset."

    "title": "Top 500 “Greatest” Novels (1021-2015)",
    "section": "HISTORY",
    "text": "HISTORY\nTo start, what is a novel? “Novel” is an umbrella term for works of longform fiction in a range of genres: romance, sci-fi, historical fiction, horror, detective fiction, westerns, etc. The word “novel” was first used in English to describe a “long fictional prose narrative” in the 1600s (OED), and the form increased in popularity across the 18th and 19th centuries. Interestingly, OCLC’s list of top 500 novels extends much further back than this. The oldest work on the list is The Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature written over 1,000 years ago. On the other end of the timeline, the list includes many contemporary best-sellers, including all the titles in the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games series.\nThis long time span is one of the things that makes OCLC’s data, and the list specifically, so interesting. A key issue in literary studies is which works from the past we continue to read in the present, and which works from the present we’ll continue to read in the future. The vast majority of novels fall out of circulation shortly after they’re published, quickly becoming part of what Margaret Cohen has called “the great unread” (Cohen 2018, 61).1 The Top 500 list, though, represents historical works that have achieved exceptional levels of attention and have entered what is often referred to as the literary “canon.” Ankhi Mukherjee defines the canon as “a set of texts whose value and readability have borne the test of time,” noting that this “involves not merely a work’s admission into an elite club, but its induction into ongoing critical dialogue and contestations of literary value” (Mukherjee (2017)). Canonical works continue to be read, taught, and discussed, and in popular terminology they’re often considered “classics.” These are works you might read in a high school or college English class: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, for example, or Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.\nOne of the things that defines a classic is the fact that it stays in print for a long period of time. When a book is published, it is issued in an edition with a specific number of physical copies. If the book is profitable, it may be re-issued in different editions over many years and edited repeatedly by different scholars across time. If it becomes canonical, it is likely to be issued in dozens or hundreds of editions even long after the author’s death, leading to more physical copies of the book in circulation. Importantly, though, there is not just one canon or one stable set of classics. Canons are constructed and reinforced by people; they are socially and historically defined and are bound up in power relationships and in histories of exclusion and erasure. This is what makes OCLC’s task of defining the top 500 greatest novels of all time so potentially problematic: their data reflects a history of canonization that has influenced library collections, and which has long been biased toward English-language texts, White male authors, and works produced in Europe and North America.2\nThe newer works included on the list are books that have achieved immense popularity and widespread sales in recent years. These works, which were published during the period that Dan Sinykin has termed the “Conglomerate Era,” are usually issued by publishers that operate as part of large, multinational corporations, and which have the resources to print and distribute millions of books around the world (Sinykin 2023). Many of these novels have also been adapted into major films or TV series.\nBy focusing on books that librarians have chosen to continue to make available to readers, OCLC was able to create a list of widely read novels that includes both classic texts and more recent, popular works by living authors. The list, though, also reflects various forms of bias rooted in literary history, in library collections, and in the data itself. We wondered, whose conception of “literary greatness” is being represented? How does OCLC’s data compare to other potential indicators of popularity or canonicity? And, for that matter, how was the list actually constructed?"

    "section": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?",
    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\n\nThe top 500 list:\nThe Top 500 list represents a massive data extraction and analysis effort on the part of OCLC. While they do not provide detailed information on how the list was compiled, they do offer a brief explanation of the process that went into creating the list on their FAQ page (written in the context of the top 100, but also applies to the top 500):\n\nMaterials in libraries are described and tracked in WorldCat in two ways. Any specific work of literature, music, art, history, etc., has an associated catalog record. This describes the item in a general sense. Every copy of the same book, for example, shares the same record. WorldCat also tracks library holdings, which indicate that a specific library has (or holds) at least one copy of that item.\n\n\nThe Library 100 is based on the total number of holdings for a specific novel across all libraries that have registered that information in WorldCat. When a library tells OCLC, “We have a copy of that book available,” that counts as a holding, and in the case of The Library 100, counts as +1 toward its ranking on the list.\n\nThis process initially sounds straightforward: to create the Top 500 list, the OCLC team presumably searched the title of a work, counted the number of libraries that held each title, and published the first 500. But when we dug into the database, we found it was actually much more complicated than that. The list is influenced by a range of factors, including which libraries’ collections are represented, what kinds of books are considered, and how holdings are totalled across different editions and translations of individual titles.\n\nWhich libraries are represented?\nAccording to OCLC, “WorldCat holdings information represents the collective inventory of OCLC member libraries” (“WorldCat Holdings” 2021). But who are these member libraries? And where are they? OCLC publishes some summary data about WorldCat, revealing, for example, that it currently holds over 548 million bibliographic records representing over 3.3 billion library holdings in 490 languages. But while OCLC stresses its position as “The worldwide catalog of library resources” and emphasizes the membership of libraries in over one hundred countries, it doesn’t provide much specific information on where these libraries are located or what kinds of institutions they are (“WorldCat Holdings” 2021).\nIn order to get a general sense of the geographic distribution of OCLC member libraries, we dug into the organization’s directory and conducted filtered searches for libraries in each country. We found that over 70% of OCLC’s members are in the U.S., followed by 7% in Germany, 4% in Australia, 2.6% in Canada, and 1.5% in the U.K. Clearly, OCLC is most well represented in the U.S., where it is based, and the fact that three of the other top four countries in terms of membership have English as a national language helps to explain why English-language materials are disproportionately represented in the catalog and in the Top 500 List.\n\n\n\nNumber of libraries in OCLC’s member database by country\n\n\nWe used a similar approach to look at what kinds of institutions are represented in WorldCat, this time filtering by “Library Type.” We found that most OCLC members are school libraries (29%), public libraries (29%), or academic libraries (25%) and that membership is fairly evenly distributed across these categories. The prominence of school libraries and academic libraries raises the issue of which patrons have access to these libraries–and thus whose conception of popularity is being represented in the holdings data. It also points to the influence of educators on this picture of the Top 500 novels.\n\n\n\nNumber of libraries in OCLC’s member database by institution type\n\n\n\n\nWhich books are represented?\nSince the list focuses specifically on novels in these libraries’ collections, it is also narrowed by genre. OCLC discusses its process for identifying novels on its FAQ page, noting that they began with “everything in WorldCat that counts broadly as ‘fiction’” and then winnowed the list down through the removal of known categories like “children’s books, poetry, drama, folklore, comics,” and “short stories.” The final list was later “reviewed by an editorial team.”\nImportantly, the Top 500 List is also based only on holdings of physical books, and it “does not include e-books, audiobooks, children’s adaptations, film adaptations, etc.” This exclusive focus on print books puts emphasis on the choices of librarians, since libraries have limited shelf space and periodically have to cull their print collections. As OCLC puts it, “libraries offer access to trendy and popular books. But, they don’t keep them on the shelf if they’re not repeatedly requested by their communities over the years.” By contrast, they suggest that ebooks are often incorporated via “automatic links to free collections on the web,” which do not “represent a specific decision to add a particular novel to a library’s collection” (“The Library 100: Frequently Asked Questions” 2023). While this may be the case, given the popularity of eBooks (Zhang and Kudva 2013), a focus on print must have influenced the overall makeup of the list, and, again, whose idea of popularity or “greatness” it represents.\n\n\nHow are editions and translations counted?\nOne further complication is that in WorldCat, records are stored by edition, meaning that each edition of a particular novel has its own catalog record. An individual title may have been released in hundreds or thousands of editions since its initial publication. Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote, for example, has over 9,000 editions listed in WorldCat.\nThis means that when developing the list, the OCLC team actually had to find all the editions of a specific title and sum the number of libraries that hold that edition across all editions. Thus the top 500 list is not only a representation of how many libraries carry the work, but a representation of how many times a book has been re-edited and re-issued; the more editions a book has, the more records are created and the more copies of a book a library may hold. Often, there are duplicate records for individual editions, which may affect the overall count of copies tallied by OCLC. And when a work is translated into different languages, all the editions of all the translations are also recorded in WorldCat, which also figures into the count of total holdings for each novel.\nThe combined influence of these different factors can be seen in the representation of works in languages other than English, which make up around 14% of the list. The non-English-language texts that are at the top of the list–Don Quixote, Crime and Punishment, Madame Bovary, The Three Musketeers, and War and Peace–have all been widely translated into English, a trend that continues as you go down the list.\n\n\n\nOur curated dataset:\nWe chose to contextualize the Library Top 500 List by compiling additional information on each novel from a range of other sources. We focused on gathering three main categories of information: information that could help us understand what types of works–and whose works–were included on the list, data that could potentially provide alternate measures of popularity or canonicity, and the full text of each novel that was in the public domain. We collected information from the following sources:\nWorldCat: we used the now-shuttered OCLC tool Classify to gather data from WorldCat based on an OWI (OCLC Work ID) for each of the 500 novels on the list.3 We recorded total physical and eholdings for this work. The Top 500 list only considers physical holdings. The number of holdings in our curated dataset is not perfectly descending as the top 500 rank decreases, as one would expect. This is likely due to complications with the OWI number and with the inclusion of translations; the top 500 list uses multiple OWIs to calculate total holdings, while we only use one. Which OWIs the top 500 curators use for each work is unclear.\nVIAF: The Virtual International Authority File is an OCLC-run database that contains structured records–called “name authority files”–for individual authors and creators. We used VIAF to gather information on authors whose novels were included on the list, including their birth and death dates, nationalities, genders, and occupations.\n\n\n\nExample of Toni Morrison’s authority record in VIAF\n\n\nWikipedia: We used Wikipedia, the popular, free, volunteer-authored encyclopedia, to identify the year of first publication for each novel on the list.\nGoodreads: Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, is the largest social networking site related to books, with over 150 million members. It allows users to rate, review, and discuss a huge range of texts. We drew on data from Goodreads as a potential alternate indicator of texts’ popularity, collecting total number of reviews, total number of ratings, and average overall rating for each novel on the list.\nProject Gutenberg: We used Project Gutenberg to access the full-text of all novels on the list that are currently in the public domain, or in other words, out of copyright. We chose Project Gutenberg because their eBooks are edited by volunteers, whereas many larger content repositories, like Internet Archive and HathiTrust, only make available machine-generated transcriptions of historical texts, which tend to be less accurate.\nOur work creating this dataset not only builds on the work of the OCLC team who compiled the Top 500 list, but on the labor of the thousands of librarians who created records held in WorldCat and VIAF, of the volunteers who transcribed texts for Project Gutenberg and wrote articles for Wikipedia, and of the social media users who reviewed and rated books on Goodreads."

    "text": "EXAMINING BIAS\n\nThe top 500 list:\nThe OCLC’s definition of “literary greatness” is biased based on the libraries that OCLC represents, the list’s exclusive focus on physical books, and its emphasis on raw number of holdings, which is influenced by number of editions. OCLC acknowledges potential biases in their claims, noting that “The [top 500] list emphasizes many books that we tend to think of as ‘classics,’ because those are the novels most often translated, retold in different editions, taught and widely distributed in library collections. Because of this, the list tends to reflect more dominant cultural views.”\nA key reason we decided to collect additional data related to the list was to explore what kinds of works, and especially whose works, it represents. Drawing on author data gathered from VIAF, we can calculate some overall descriptive statistics for the list.\nLooking at the AUTHOR_GENDER column, we can count the number of authors identified as male and the number identified as female (VIAF only includes options for binary genders, which is discussed further below), and we can see that over 70% of the novels were written by men.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../../../datasets/top-500-novels/final_merged_dataset_no_full_text.tsv\", sep='\\t', header=0, low_memory=False)\n\ndf[\"author_gender\"].value_counts(dropna=False)\n\n\nauthor_gender\nmale      355\nfemale    145\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nWe can use a similar approach to look at the nationalities of authors whose works are represented on the list. Focusing on the AUTHOR_NATIONALITY column, we can count how many times each country code appears, and see that over 80% of the novels were written by authors from the U.S. or the U.K.\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"author_nationality\"].value_counts(dropna=False)\n\n\nauthor_nationality\nUS    257\nGB    149\nFR     27\nRU     10\nDE     10\nCA      8\nIE      8\nIT      5\nSE      4\nCZ      3\nCO      3\nAU      3\nCH      2\nCL      2\nES      1\nZA      1\nBR      1\nJP      1\nCN      1\nNG      1\nPL      1\nMX      1\nIN      1\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth map representing the number of works by authors of particular nationalities represented on the Top 500 List\n\n\nTo find out what time period is most frequently represented on the list, we can look at the PUB_YEAR column and see that almost 50% of novels were first published between 1950 and 2000.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\nbins = np.arange(1000, 2060, 50)\nbars = df['pub_year'].plot.hist(bins=bins, edgecolor='w')\nplt.xticks(rotation='vertical');\nplt.xticks(bins);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also get a sense of the immense influence of individual authors who appear on the list numerous times. The most represented authors are John Grisham (19 novels) and Charles Dickens (15 novels).\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"author\"].value_counts(dropna=False).head(10)\n\n\nauthor\nJohn Grisham            19\nCharles Dickens         15\nJohn Steinbeck           8\nC.S.

This suggests that the more editions a novel has, the more likely it is to be higher on the list, which is relevant because European and American editing practices have long favored authors occupying dominant social positions. Historically, works by White authors and male authors are more likely to have been re-edited and re-issued and to be considered literary classics (Gates; Mandell).4\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\n# inspired by: https://www.sfu.ca/~mjbrydon/tutorials/BAinPy/08_correlation.html\n\nsns.lmplot(x=\"oclc_editions_rank\", y=\"top_500_rank\", data=df)\ndropped_df = df[df.oclc_editions_rank.notna()]\nprint(stats.pearsonr(dropped_df['oclc_editions_rank'], dropped_df['top_500_rank']))\n\n\nPearsonRResult(statistic=np.float64(0.6985608812420623), pvalue=np.float64(1.1165447422670264e-73))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we confirm that there is a very strong positive correlation (p=5.6541e-96, r=0.7642) between number of editions and number of holdings of a novel; the more editions a book has, the more total holdings are reported in OCLC.\n\n\nCode\nsns.lmplot(x=\"oclc_holdings_rank\", y=\"oclc_editions_rank\", data=df)\ndropped_df = df[df.oclc_editions_rank.notna() & df.oclc_holdings_rank.notna()]\nprint(stats.pearsonr(dropped_df['oclc_holdings_rank'], dropped_df['oclc_editions_rank']))\n\n\nPearsonRResult(statistic=np.float64(0.7642639335763275), pvalue=np.float64(5.6541076909547544e-96))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur curated dataset:\nAlthough the additional data we curated helps to contextualize the Top 500 List and to reveal some of its biases, the data we added also contains its own biases. For starters, as researchers, we both primarily work in English, and we are pursuing this project at a University in the U.S. These contexts have informed our areas of inquiry and the sources we’ve chosen to use. We primarily drew on widely used online databases created in English-language contexts (VIAF, Project Gutenberg, etc.). Further, we have limited our data collection to OCLC’s list of the Top 500 novels and did not attempt to expand to other rankings of literary greatness or to additional novels.\nThe sources we have used, of course, have biases of their own. VIAF relies on a standardized vocabulary, which can be helpful for data analysis and organization, but erases important nuances. For example, VIAF categorizes gender with the binary labels of “male” and “female,” with the only other option being “unknown.” This, of course, reinforces binary understandings of gender and obscures the existence of non-binary people (Drabinski (2013)). Labels used in fields like “AUTHOR_NATIONALITY,” “FIELD_OF_ACTIVITY,” and “OCCUPATION” also do not paint a complete picture. The entries in the latter two columns are based on Library of Congress data and may not be equally rich for all authors. And nationality labels from VIAF can obfuscate racial, political, ethnic, and tribal affiliations, and flatten the complexity of individual authors’ experiences.5 For example, the nationality for Sherman Alexie, author of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-time Indian, is listed as “U.S.A.”, but his identity as a member of the Spokane Tribe of Indians is not referenced. In another example, the first nationality listed for Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner, is “U.S.A.” followed by “Afghanistan.” This is not inaccurate but it is oversimplified, since Hosseini was born in Kabul, lived in Iran, France, and Afghanistan throughout his childhood, and then moved to California after his family sought political asylum in the U.S.\nWe urge researchers using this dataset to consider its biases when drawing conclusions, and to seek other sources to expand it, question it, and/or to fill in information that may be missing or lacking.\nYou can find more metadata analysis in this notebook."

    "text": "POPULARITY VS CANONICITY\nBecause we were interested in whose opinions are represented on the list, we wanted to bring in an alternate measure of popularity, and we decided to use information from Goodreads. Goodreads was appealing because of its prominence online (over 130 million users), which we hoped might help us consider the opinions of a somewhat different set of readers than those theoretically represented through the physical holdings of libraries. Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak, for example, have drawn on Goodreads reviews to analyze how social media users define the “Classics.” Drawing on this work, we compare the ranking of novels on OCLC’s original list of Top 500 novels to the rankings of those same novels based on Goodreads ratings and number of reviews. Through this comparison we aim to consider how social media users engage with “classic” and “popular” novels and to interrogate the relationship between canonicity and popularity, using information from different data sources.\nTo unpack the differences between the Goodreads data and the Top 500 rankings, we first need to think about how we want to compare the two lists. Given that we have recorded Goodread rankings by average star rating and total number of ratings, which metric would be better to use? Would we want to create another metric?\nFor our purposes, we decided to use total number of ratings instead of average rating, since it seemed most closely related to how OCLC measures popularity–by number of holdings, not how much patrons say they enjoy reading the books.\n\n\nCode\ndef top_5_comparison(col_name):\n  print(df[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\n  sorted = df.sort_values(by=[col_name])\n  print(sorted[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\ntop_5_comparison(\"gr_num_ratings_rank\")\n\n\n                                title                  author  top_500_rank  \\\n0                         Don Quixote     Miguel de Cervantes             1   \n1    Alice's Adventures in Wonderland           Lewis Carroll             2   \n2  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn              Mark Twain             3   \n3        The Adventures of Tom Sawyer              Mark Twain             4   \n4                     Treasure Island  Robert Louis Stevenson             5   \n\n   gr_num_ratings_rank  \n0                  211  \n1                  133  \n2                   68  \n3                   88  \n4                  145  \n                                     title               author  top_500_rank  \\\n44   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone         J.K.

The type-token ratio will tell us which genres contain the most unique words.\nThe type-token ratio is a simple expression that calculates # of unique words / total words in a selection. As you may be able to surmise, sometimes this ratio is naturally higher for shorter books. To avoid this bias, we randomly select a contiguous 1000 word sample from each book and average the scores across genres.\nIt’s helpful to be able to store all of our data in a dataframe, but sometimes we want to work with just one column of the data and converting it into a different datatype can be helpful.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Top 500 List is presented in a straightforward manner. It is just a list of 500 novels that are widely held in library collections along with their authors. But when you start to dig into the data underlying the list, it gets much, much more complicated.\nThe list draws on hundreds of millions of library records representing billions of library holdings. This is such a vast amount of information that it may appear to provide opportunities to draw comprehensive conclusions. However, the data overwhelmingly represents the holdings of libraries in the U.S.A., the majority of which are also connected to some sort of educational institution. Though it claims to represent great novels from around the world, the list primarily includes English-language novels and novels popular in English translation.\nThe list also represents the disproportionate influence of academics and publishers, who chose to re-edit and re-issue certain texts and not others. The correlation we found between number of editions and number of holdings is likely to make intuitive sense to library users–especially users of academic libraries, which tend to hold many editions of classic texts, and which often continue to purchase these texts as they are re-edited and re-issued. Histories of canonization in the U.S. and Europe have long been biased toward works by White, male, middle and upper class authors–a fact which clearly influenced the composition of the list.\nIn pointing out these biases we do not intend to criticize OCLC for producing the list, which provides a useful snapshot of some of the most widely held works in their database and represents a tremendous data curation and analysis effort. We do, however, want to question the notion that “literary greatness” can be measured by the number of physical copies of a book held on library shelves. It is important to dig into data that is used to make universal claims, especially when it evidences such strong biases toward a single linguistic tradition, toward particular geographic regions, and toward individual authors. John Grisham’s work appears nineteen times on this list, Charles Dickens’s work appears fifteen times, and John Steinbeck and C.S. Lewis’s work each appears eight times. What does it mean to posit that these four men wrote ten percent of the greatest novels across all languages and cultures across all time?\nWhile each of these works deserves individual attention, looking at literary data in aggregate can help to reveal some of these biases and trends across a larger number of texts, and across library collections. We hope this dataset provides fruitful opportunities for exploration, and we have included a few more suggestions for analysis here."

We follow Cohen’s use of the term.↩︎\nWe capitalize “White” following Sonita Sarker, who writes, “The capital letter ‘W’ indicates that White is a collective identity. The term has mostly indicated individuals, in the use of the lower case ‘w,’ signifying at once the unique humanity of (white) personhood and absolving them of collective responsibility in White supremacy” (Sarker 2023)↩︎\nFor more on how editions of works are clustered in WorldCat see “Clustering WorldCat Discovery.”↩︎\nLaura Mandell argues that “women writers are being recovered and forgotten in cycles, both in print and potentially in digital media,” pointing out that historically “works by men have been published and republished” while “women writers only appear in the materiality of the single print run” (Mandell (2015)). In his work on “What Makes a ‘Classic’ African American Text,” Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical exclusion of Black authors from the Penguin Classics series, as well as his work editing a new series of African American Classics for the imprint. He notes that “texts by people of color, and texts by women” are “still struggling, despite enormous gains over the last twenty years, to gain a solid foothold in anthologies and syllabi.” These kinds of biases in turn affect which works appear on library shelves.↩︎\nSafiya Umoja Noble argues that “information organization is a matter of sociopolitical and historical processes that serve particular interests,” tying library cataloging and classification systems to “the development of racial classification” in the 19th century (136-137). And Roopika Risam also highlights the role of public-sector knowledge institutions in perpetuating these structural biases, emphasizing “the failure to take into account the complicity of universities, libraries, and the cultural heritage sector in devaluing black and indigenous lives and perpetuating the legacies of colonialism in the cultural and digital cultural records alike” (14).↩︎"

    "text": "History of Gender-Violence at the Border\nSome of the material in this section comes from forthcoming work, specifically Fernández Quintanilla & Bejarano’s “Fuerza Feminista: Confronting Intersectional Data Violence by Archiving the Movement against Anti-Feminicides in the Paso del Norte Region” (forthcoming 2025) and Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano’s “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities” (forthcoming 2025).\n\nFor over thirty years, the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua bordering Texas and New Mexico has experienced multiple forms of violence across its rural and urban regions. Communities have been besieged with cartels and gender-based violence, and in Ciudad Juárez, international corporations pay workers less than livable wages. An overwhelming amount of attention has focused on Ciudad Juárez for cases of feminicide—that is, the murder of women based on their gender—and scholars have pointed to the early 1990s as a period when these murders gained international recognition. During this time, families of disappeared and murdered women, as well as activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and national and international human rights regimes, clamored over the hundreds of women and girls who disappeared and were never found, or whose remains were located near or within Ciudad Juárez (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Lagarde y de los Ríos, 2010; Driver, 2015; Lozano, 2019). While concentrated attention was given to the feminicides at that time, over the years, less focus has been given to the galvanizing efforts of local people to demand responses from authorities to resolve these atrocities (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\nDespite the increased social awareness, local community activism, formation of local organizations and nonprofits, and foreign academic interventions, there is still no satisfactory response from Mexican authorities regarding Mexican feminicides or feminicidios. Among the notable and progressive changes that have occurred to bring justice to the murdered women and girls is the legal classification of feminicide, or feminicidio, which was coined and inserted into Mexican legal framework by Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos and collaborators (Monárrez Fregoso, Rosa-Linda, and Bejarano 2020). The term feminicide emerged from Diana Russell and Jill Radford’s feminicide: The Politics of Woman Killing (1992), which proposed a feminist approach in addressing the disproportionate killing of women by differentiating these murders from general homicides. Although the direct translation of feminicide to Spanish is femicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos argued that it was not enough to classify these murders as separate from homicide; thus, she coined feminicidio. By naming feminicide, feminicidio, Lagarde y de los Ríos expanded on the definition of feminicide to “name the ensemble of violations of women’s human rights, which contain the crimes against and the disappearances of women” (2020). The term feminicidio acknowledges that the killing of women is an institutional and systemic violence, meaning that feminicidios occur because of the authorities’ omission, negligence, and/or collusion with the assailants which inhibits women’s access to justice and thereby contributes to impunity. \nFeminist activists, digital activists, activist-scholars, and everyday people world-wide are vigorously working to engage in data-keeping mobilizations to document and protest feminicides and gender-based violence. These data-keeping resistance movements collect data to contest the intersectional violence that authorities create and foment. Feminist data projects galvanize record-keeping efforts to maintain and even recover data and make visible the extent of gender-based violence in communities across the Global South and Global North. There are several prominent feminist data projects documenting gender-based violence in existence across the Americas. These projects primarily focus on data that is counting feminicides from specific BIPOC women’s groups or regions, and visualizing these crimes through spreadsheets, repositories, and other forms of data visualization such as maps and infographics. Collectively, the data from these projects have served the anti-feminicide movement as tools to counter the erasure or minimization of feminicides that authorities will often claim.  Digital projects like Ellas Tienen Nombre and Ecos del Desierto and archival collections like the Ester Cano Chavez Collection are powerful examples of how civil society organizations, everyday people, and families take the responsibility of collecting this feminist data and doing the work of the authorities. They provide transparency and an unofficial record of data with the use of digital technologies and collaborative practices with professionals in libraries and archival studies, visual studies, geographical information systems, web developers, and other allies. Thus, these types of resources provide a digital record with critical data that impacts the lives of many families and serves as a tool to seek justice (Fernandez Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)"

    "text": "WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM? WHO COLLECTED IT?\n\nDataset Translation & Digitization\nA group of undergraduate students at the University of Texas at San Antonio digitized and translated the original feminicide dataset provided by El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra as part of the Honor’s course, “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” (Fall 2023) taught by Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla and Paulina Hernández-Trejo. The students are Jasbeth Medrano (Political Science), Carolina Vlaun (English), Judith Ordonez (Film and Media), Alex Sanchez (Computer Science), and Samuel Friedrich (Kinesiology).\n\n\nOriginal Dataset Authors\nThis dataset was included, in part, at the end of the book, El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra, by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. The book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of feminicide, with an emphasis on providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. It was published by Ediciones del Azar A.C. in November 1999. There were 1001 copies distributed, and no editions have been published since.\n\n\n\nFront page of the book El silencio que la voz de todas\n\n\nAt the end of the book, the authors included an image of a spreadsheet with all the cases of feminicde they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit within a print book format.\n\n\n\n\nPart one of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case\n\n\n\n\n\nPart two of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case\n\n\n\n\n\nMap created by authors mapping all the cases included in the spreadsheet\n\n\nThe spreadsheet is only accessible through this book, making it hard for others to study this data or advance this cause. Though there is a scanned version of the book circulating on the internet, the spreadsheet featured in the book is not complete. Additionally, the printed book is not on sale anymore, and it requires a special process to request the book from libraries that have a copy.\n\n\nEl Silencio intentionally humanizes the women and girls in the dataset through testimonios of their mothers and family members. According to its introductory chapter, El Silencio’s larger objective was not just the contribution of the dataset, but rather an intimate encounter between the testimonies of the victims’ mothers and the dataset.\n\nThis book does not feature any of the perpetrators or suspects, aligning with its objective of highlighting the lives, not the deaths, of these women and girls. Thus, El Silencio highlights the lives of Erendira, Sagrario, Olga Alicia, Elizabeth, Adriana, Silvia Elena, and Argelia in detail in between the chapters discussing the creation of the dataset. As the authors reiterate, Ciudad Juárez “should be remembered not only for its feminicides, but also for its women who live a common life, perhaps like our own, one like your mother, your sister or your daughter….the victims should never be considered ‘the problem’ or stigmatized for their deaths; the silence, self-censorship, complicity, and negligence are what should outrage and shame us” (Benítez et al. 1999, 6)."

    "text": "WHY WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? HOW IS THE DATA USED?\nOriginally the data was collected due to the lack of response from Mexican authorities and the United States government, and their failure to take seriously the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua and its surrounding area. Faced with this silence, the mothers and family members of victims, as well as activists, human rights defenders, and others, worked individually and collectively to learn ways to gather information to fight for justice and policy changes, and to work on different cases that have not yet been solved.\nThe original spreadsheet in El Silencio was created by the authors of the book, who were writers and journalists working for local newspapers (_El Diario _and El Norte) in Cd. Juarez. They started to collect data related to missing and murdered women since 1990 through newspaper reports and government reports, corroborating with some of the mothers and family members through their testimonios. This spreadsheet was one of the first kinds of data that accounted for the feminicides in Cd. Juarez and its surrounding area in the early 1990s when these cases started to gain national and international attention. This data has been used for legal cases and for further investigation of the cases documented, as well as for other activists and scholars to continue advocating for justice in physical and digital spaces through initiatives that keep track of this counterdata [dignazio_counting_2024]. Some examples are:\n\nAccountant and founder of Casa Amiga, Esther Chavez Cano, who collected all the newspapers and documents of cases of feminicides. Part of the collection was donated to Special Collection in New Mexico State University; the rest is in Casa Amiga.\nActivist and professor Julia Monarrez, author of Trama de una Injusticia: Feminicidio Sexual Sistémico en Ciudad Juárez, who has been working on a database with detailed information of cases in the 90s and more recently.\nActivist Ivonne Ramirez, creator of Ellas Tienen Nombre, who worked on a database of feminicides from 1993 to the present and visualized them in a digital map.\n\nFor the “Border Women and Feminist Cartography” (Fall 2023) course, the printed spreadsheet of El Silencio was chosen to be translated into English and digitized with additional information found in the digital record to enable a larger audience to have access to this data. There is a need to update materials created in earlier era in order to advance the processing and accessibility of previous data work."

    "section": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?",
    "text": "HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\nThe original data was collected through research in newspapers reporting the cases, testimonios with the mothers and family members, and through authorities’ reports and other legal documents. By consulting with and researching various sources, Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez) compiled the data of each case together.\nStudents included additional data collected through web research related to news reports about the cases published locally and internationally. Students also produced English translations with an eye toward choosing words that best represent the meanings in Spanish; a consideration of terminology used by activists and those involved in the movement; and an effort to avoid the dehumanization of these women. Relatedly, any image or article on the internet that reinforced the interpretation of these cases as death bodies, pieces of body or disposable bodies was not included. Thus, the process of making this dataset into a digital and bilingual format followed previous research and observations from feminist scholars and human rights defenders to use ethical and responsible practices when working with data related to gender violence and feminicides across geopolitical, digital and linguistic borders.\nJasbeth Medrano, the student leader overseeing the digitization and translation of the dataset, elaborated on some of the translation choices that they made: &gt; We…wanted to translate the information from Spanish to English to ensure we could reach a larger audience. Each of these parts required a particular level of care and ethics, especially when translating. For example, there were certain abbreviations in the original dataset that my group assumed for the purpose of transcribing (i.e., my group assumed that “p. Negro” was referring to “pelo negro”, which we translated as “black hair”). We were also careful to not translate geographical locations, such as street names, because translating these points would result in inaccurate information (i.e. choosing to keep “Calle Oro” vs. “Gold Street”) (Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)."

    "text": "WHAT DATA IS MISSING? HOW IS UNCERTAINTY HANDLED?\nIn the original spreadsheet, there is missing and non-identified data in the cases due to how the cases were handled by authorities where intersectional data violence was present by those in charge of the cases (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025). Nevertheless, the authors of this spreadsheet made plenty of efforts to include the most accurate and humanized data from each case, especially by bringing to their methodology the testimonios of the mother and other family members.\nWhile creating the digitized and translated dataset, the students realized that most of these cases are not documneted on the internet or in the digital record. The only ones that are present from the early 1990s are the ones that became internationally known, and for these cases, there are some news reports that still circulate. They realized that the cases of feminicide that are more present on the web are cases that are more recent and that have been the focus of digital activism and awareness-raising, often through hashtags and posts."

    "text": "Future Directions\nThere are many ways that this dataset can be and should be expanded upon. We encourage further inquiry using this translated and digitized dataset for future projects related to transnational feminism, decolonial methodologies, and researching examples of grassroots counterdata. Some of the possible further explorations include using machine learning to find more information on the cases with missing data, which would further center the victims’ lives versus her cause of death. Information could include her achievements, her work, and her everyday life as a woman.\nAdditionally, these types of courses are very urgent and necessary in higher education as it prepares students to foster caring, ethical and responsible practices using, analyzing and designing technologies using data of violence issues that the world has been facing throughout centuries. In this course, we noticed that much of the sources were counterdata of gender violence and femincidies still exist in analog formats or in public spaces showing the need to foster solidarity initiatives that can work to digitize, digitally process, preserve and have accessibility protocols towards newspapers, letters, documents, photographs, artifacts, testimonios that hold a very valuable memory. Similarly, it is crucial to keep advocating for multilingual and translingual digital humanities and integrate materials and sources from different parts of the world in order to move out of the comfort zone and expose students to realistic research scenarios where data is multilingual (not just in English) and not easily accessible/legible."

Through a close and distant reading analysis students enhance in the development of multilingual humanities datasets to explore a series of thematical feminist cartographies through transnational, intersectional, antiracist, geographical and historical frameworks. Additionally, students explore various methods and digital tools and software with public datasets to convert these excerpts into a series of informative critical data visualizations.\nThroughout the course, relevant social, historical, cultural readings, digital material, visual aids, interviews and workshops with writers, critics, activists, project creators and data specialists were included to help students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Overall, students engage in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing at the intersection of feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping and data science.\n\n\n\nPoster presented by the course instructors at the Academic Data Science Alliance on October 24-27, 2023 at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Data Science School."

    "text": "Data Curation Final Projects\nIn the Final Module—&gt;Atando cabos, students were divided into six teams and were assigned to create a responsible dataset in context under a particular theme discussed in this course. Every team was tasked with a different form of approaching data, thus deciding on a methodology that will work best under the scenario they faced. Throughout this process they encountered several challenges that exposed them work with missing, uncontextualized, wrong data, data in other languages than English, the digital divide, the pre-digital age, lack of information in the digital cultural record, and the need to do field work or work closely with individuals, community members or organizations involved. Additionally, they had great observations of future work that can be done with these datasets or to make this data more accessible in other platforms to better serve those who are advocating for justice in the public and political level, as well as to expand the research on this data of counting feminicides and human rights movements.\n\nDataset #1: Tracing Feminicides in El Paso, Texas Using the Hispanic-American Newspaper Newsbank-Readex Collection\n\nTeam: Jessica Corona (Leader), Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, & Sara Mosher\nProject Link\nDataset description: Since the beginning of society in the United States, stereotypes and representations of women have been created to oppress them. Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n\nDataset #2: Digital and Translated Version of “El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio” Printed Spreadsheet\n\nTeam: Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille\nProject Link\nDataset Description: As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of feminicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset.\nDataset dissemination: visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n\nDataset #3: Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).\n\nTeam: Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, Kiri Avelar, & Paris Cantu\nProject Link\nDataset Description: The project’s purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were Woman Hollering Creek (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories (1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from Woman Hollering Creek and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in The Mystery of Survival. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters’ experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n\nDataset #4: Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World\n\nTeam: Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla, Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill\nProject Link\nDataset Description: In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected. Though we are still predominantly shining our light on women and gender-based violence, we found other marginalized communities that can have their messages shared. Films like Killers of the Flower Moon showcase violence based on the Osage community and other similar native American communities, and Milk which shows an openly gay politician fighting to break out of the glass ceiling. These films, though show\ndifferent variations and levels of violence, intersectionality of present, it shows the trials these marginalized communities have faced. While engaged in the data collection and analysis we wanted to highlight these stories as well as leave it strictly to gender-based violence toward women. At the end, the dataset evolved and can be defined into four main takeaways/themes: personification of violence, definitions of violence, representation of genre, and missing stories. The first takeaway was the personification of violence; breaking this down into the on-screen, almost jarring reality of the possible glorification, stylization, and informative analysis of violence on screen. Our team felt that many of the films listed on the dataset could be argued and grouped into any one of the said narratives. This allows the audience to further their own definitions of gender violence in film. This does lead to the next takeaway, definitions. Throughout the construction of the dataset, we noticed a common theme with films depicting gender violence and/or having a main plot point be that of gendered violence. Many of the films listed are defined and categorized as “romances”. Films like Urban Cowboy, I, Tonya, and Lolita are all defined as romances; all these films depict graphic scenes of abuse, both physical and mental. Our question as a group is how does depicting and defining this film impact viewers? Are they glorifying? Are they stylizing? Are they informing? Our third takeaway was the cross-representation of genre. The dataset is broad - it includes films, biopics, documentaries, docuseries, horror, historical dramas, science fiction, and many more. We discovered that genre can be a visual but also narrative aid and representation with overall thematic analysis in relation to a film. Many of the films that we listed focused on and outlined meaningful, non-voyeuristic representational work on the issue of violence against women. All the films, across genres, in most ways, were symbolic of violating the heteronormative values of women and other marginalized groups in media; all following the steppingstones of action, resistance, and retribution. The last takeaway was the missing stories that we, as a group, found that were absent after completing the dataset. Again, it is a broad dataset, but there are still not enough individual, personal stories being represented. Many of our films fall under two categories: white, cis-female representation and wide-releases in English-speaking countries. There is a gap in our data that we must be aware of for the future of the dataset. The stories these films captured span from 1918 to the present, but there are still missing stories, missing people who need to be heard through the media of film.\nDataset dissemination: app, visualizations, image analysis, digital repository and digital exhibit\n\nDataset #5: Books and Articles from Mexico and the U.S. Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Jared Pond (Leader), Emily Malloy (Leader), Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, & Ambonnay Rodriguez\nProject Link\nDataset Description: This dataset project was to call attention to feminicide and gender violence in scholarly literature. We wanted to show that these women are remembered and were failed by their society and protectors. To make people uncomfortable enough to understand the seriousness of this topic, and to show that there are people keeping track and those who care. Our dataset tracks information on pieces of scholarly literature primarily from the U.S. and Mexico that relate to feminicide and gender violence. This dataset can be used to compare the types of literature and how it is represented across different publishing houses and countries. And the noticeable absence of information from publishing houses in Mexico. Some of our findings include the trait of Chicano, Hispanic, and Mexican authors publishing in areas other than Mexico, leading to the question of how much, and how hard the government and society itself tries to hide this violence. For example, some of the first books touching on these topics like El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra or Cosecha de Mujeres had trouble finding a publisher and had even issues with some editors in charge. Our limitations included: authors not being on the internet, authors being hidden by other authors’ articles by other interpretations, and not being able to fully investigate and read every single piece of literature we listed. We also understand that we did not incorporate as many essays, articles, and books as there are in other databases as well. The next step for this project is to keep expanding on these works in any way possible. Those who work on this dataset may be able to make more connections between the data than we were able to see as their background knowledge is different than ours; or maybe even more resources than we do. We also recognize that we are missing data and possibly have inaccuracies, but it’s clear that feminicide has become more apparent globally and is something that nobody should be quiet about.\n\nDataset #6: Murals and Public Monuments Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence\n\nTeam: Nilou Esmaeili (Leader), Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson\nProject Link\nDataset Description: For this final dataset project, as a group we scavenged data pertaining to murals and monuments placed throughout Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, other various cities throughout Mexico, and internationally. The purpose of this dataset is to hopefully bring awareness to how frequently gender-based violence occurs especially in hotspots such as areas around the US-Mexican border, throughout Mexican cities, other countries of more conservative nature, more populated countries, etc… The list can go on, but the point is, that gender-based violence happens worldwide every day whether we witness it or not. Most of the data sources were from social media sites such as Instagram and X (Twitter). We encountered that when scrolling through these applications, there are a lot of bots, inappropriate content, threats, and unrelated posts. It was frustrating because social media is a good source to pull current information and data from, but navigating was annoying. Originally, our purpose would’ve been to create a program (code) to help the team members easily navigate and pick out the data needed throughout the loads of data and posts we go through on articles and social media sites. Unfortunately, it requires more advanced coding skills to create this program because it utilizes AI databases and even creating databases for the AI coding working with this data requires field work to process this data. Student comment: “I encounter having to interact with data in a way I have not even begun learning nor brushed up on in any of my classes. For reasons such as that, I scrapped my program completely and just manually mined data for our project. It would’ve been a nice way to make it easier for not only me and my groupmates, but my other classmates to use.”\nDataset dissemination: mapping, image analysis, digital and 3D exhibits, virtual reality"

Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n\nDataset #2: Digital and Translated Version of “El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio” Printed Spreadsheet\n\nTeam: Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille\nDataset Description: As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of feminicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset.\nDataset dissemination: visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n\nDataset #3: Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).\n\nTeam: Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, Kiri Avelar, & Paris Cantu\nDataset Description: The project’s purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were Woman Hollering Creek (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories (1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from Woman Hollering Creek and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in The Mystery of Survival. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters’ experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between Woman Hollering Creek and The Mystery of Survival as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\nDataset dissemination: mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n\nDataset #4: Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World\n\nTeam: Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla, Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill\nDataset Description: In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected.

    "text": "What’s in the data?\nAlongside the names and states of each governor, the dataset includes information on gender, educational background, as well as other characteristics. The dataset is based on the publicly-available biographies of governors from the National Governors Association (NGA). We capture the following variables from the website:\n\nstate_territory: U.S. state or territory where the governor served.\ngovernor: Full name of the governor, as listed on the website. The listed name is not always the legal name of the person, e.g. John Ellis Bush Jr. is listed as Jeb Bush.\nparty: Political party affiliation under which the governor served.\nyears_in_office: Concatenated string denoting term(s) in office (e.g., “1985–1991; 1995–1999”). Parsed from web biographies. - school: Educational institution(s) attended by the governor as listed on the official profile. If multiple schools are listed, usually separated by semicolons (e.g., “Brigham Young University; Harvard University”). If NA, either no school is listed or the governor did not attend college.\nbirth_state_territory: Parsed location (state) of birth based on text extraction.\nspouse: Name of spouse, if available. If NA, the governor is either not married or spousal information is unknown.\nbirth_date: Date of birth, as listed on website.\nbio_text: Raw string of the biographical background of the governor. In 14 cases (less than 1 percent of cases), this biographical text is missing.\n\nUsing the above information extracted from the NGA, we construct the following columns:\n\ncollege attendance: Equals 1 if the governor attended any college or university; 0 otherwise.\nivy attendance: Equals 1 if the governor attended an Ivy League institution; 0 otherwise. (Note that this technically applies for EITHER graduate or undergraduate).\nlawyer: Equals 1 if the biography indicates legal education or professional law practice; 0 otherwise.\nmilitary_service: Equals 1 if the biography mentions military service (e.g., Army, Navy, National Guard, etc.); 0 otherwise.\nage_at_start: Age of the governor at the beginning of their first term, calculated from the reported date of birth and the start date of their first gubernatorial term.\ngender: Predicted gender label male or female based on first name and time period using the gender R package. In 9 cases, this algorithm failed to predict a gender, most frequently in cases of Indigenous or Latino governors: Togiola T. A. Tulafono (American Samoa), Benígno Fitial (Northern Mariana Islands), etc. In these cases, we manually extract the gender of the governor based on pronouns in their biography.\nborn_in_state_territory: 1 if the governor was born in the same U.S. state/territory they governed; 0 if born elsewhere (including outside the U.S.).\nintl_born: Equals 1 if the governor was born outside of the United States (as defined by the contemporary definition of the 50 states and territories); 0 otherwise. To signify internationally-born, if birth_state was labeled as “Other”, we recognize these governors as international.\nintl_born_details: To get more information on governors born outside the US, we search the bio text of governors with birth_state equivalent to “Other.” We extract their likely birthplace as a string.\n\nThe data reveal notable shifts in the backgrounds of U.S. governors over the past 250 years. In the late 18th century, governors were disproportionately elite, with slightly under half having attended college. For reference, by 1870 only one percent of the US population attended college, so 50 percent is exceptionally high almost a century earlier. During the Progressive Era in the early 20th century, reformers emphasized education and professionalization in public life (including in city and local government and the federal government). This is reflected in a sharp increase in college attendance among governors between 1875-1900 and 1900-1925. Note: All line plots in this essay use grey dots to represent yearly average and purple dots to represent 25 year binned averages.\n\n\nCode\n# Note on installation: https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/\n\n# install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n\n# too big\n# library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n# Load National Park Visitation data\ngov_dataset &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context/refs/heads/main/datasets/gubernatorial-bios/gubernatorial_bios_final.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n## Create long form version of the data where each year has the set of governors who governed in that year.

    "text": "Why Was The Data Collected? How Is The Data Used?\nThe data were collected to systematically document the biographical backgrounds of U.S. governors over time. This project builds on a growing literature in political science that treats the personal characteristics of politicians— such as elite education, professional background, or family ties to politics—as potentially consequential for how they govern. (Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Snyder 2009) examine political dynasties in the U.S. Congress, using biographical records to identify kinship ties and measure their persistence. In the U.K., (Fresh 2024) constructs a new dataset on Members of Parliament and applies natural language processing to biographical texts to code members’ business backgrounds, distinguishing established economic elites from emerging commercial elites in early modern Britain.\nCompared to US Congress and the UK Parliament, U.S. governors remain relatively under-studied. Yet governors have long played pivotal roles in American politics, from championing progressive reforms in the early 20th century (Berman 2019), to managing managing public health and disaster responses (see literature (Baccini and Brodeur 2021) related to COVID-19), to shaping national outcomes through gerrymandering as recently as August 2025. Existing research on gubernatorial behavior, particularly during the pandemic, tends to focus narrowly on party affiliation and lacks both biographical depth and historical perspective. (Sobel and Raimo 1978) is an exception and a major work on gubernatorial biographies but has not been extended to our knowledge or arranged into tabular form. This dataset helps fill that gap by systematically documenting governors’ backgrounds. This will enable new analyses of who governs the states, how elite their backgrounds are, and how such backgrounds have evolved over time.\nFor example, the next figure shows the share of governors with military service. As expected, service rates were higher during major conflicts such as the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam. In contrast, service during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars appears comparable to peacetime levels.\n\n\nCode\n## Let's get average military rate by elected governors for each year\nyearly_military &lt;- gov_long %&gt;%\n    group_by(year) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n        total = n(),\n        military = sum(military_service == 1, na.rm = TRUE),\n        pct_military = 100 * military / total,\n        .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n\n# 2.

    "text": "How Was The Data Collected?\nTo build a new individual-level data set, we web-scrape all former United States governors from the NGA. The function reads in a web-page for a given state and returns the basic information that NGA has for that state, e.g., California. The function then searches into each governor’s subpage. Here, the NGA has a biographical background paragraph on each governor, e.g., Arnold Schwarnegger. We repeat for the current set of governors, found here.\nWe also scrape terms from the top of their page. For example, consider the background of Arnold Schwarzenegger. This allows us to ascertain his political party, his terms in office, birthdate (and therefore age when entering office), his university, and that his birthplace is outside the US.\n\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s NGA page\n\n\nWe use basic text extraction techniques to identify certain key biographical attributes. With Arnold Schwarnegger, we extract his birth country from his text bio.\n\n“Arnold Schwarzenegger came to the governorship of California following a distinguished career in body building, business, and entertainment. Schwarzenegger was born in Austria and at 20 became the youngest person to win the Mr. Universe title. He won an unprecedented 12 more world bodybuilding titles. Schwarzenegger earned a college degree from the University of Wisconsin and became a U.S. citizen in 1983. Former President George H.W. Bush appointed him Chair of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1990. He also served as Chair of the California Governor’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under California Governor Pete Wilson. He married Maria Shriver in 1986 and has remained closely involved in Special Olympics, an organization founded by her late mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.\nSchwarzenegger became the 38th Governor of California pursuant to a recall election to replace Governor Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger’s accomplishments as governor include a bipartisan agreement to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions by signing landmark legislation in 2006, increasing the minimum wage while lowering the state’s unemployment rate, and overhauling the workers’ compensation system—cutting costs by more than 35 percent. Schwarzenegger made major investments in improving California’s aging infrastructure through his Strategic Growth Plan, helping to reduce congestion and clean the air.”\n\nIn total, the full sample is of 2,486 individuals from 55 states and territories, including governors from Puerto Rico (1949-present), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands.

    "text": "Uncertainty in the Data\nThe lawyer indicator indicator is likely among the more error-prone variables in the dataset. It is constructed first by considering whether the governor listed his/her law school in the ``school” listing, as was occasionally done. Then, it uses regular expression matching to identify whether a governor’s biography contains terms such as lawyer, law degree, studied law, legal practice, or school of law. This approach may miss individuals who practiced law but whose biographies do not contain these specific phrases, particularly in earlier periods.\nAnother interesting inconsistency in the data is the birth_date column. For example, let’s take a look at Gov. Sam Houston Jones of Louisiana.\n\n\n\nSam Houston Jones’ NGA page where his birth year is after his term start\n\n\nDespite having his term start in 1940, the NGA site has Jones’ birth date in 1987, which unless Jones was a time traveler, isn’t passing a basic sanity check. Obviously, the NGA made a mistake, Jones was born in 1897, but Jones is not the only one. We found 17 governors in the dataset whose birth date was after their term start. We manually corrected the subset whose birth date was after or too close to their term start in the dataset, but those are unlikely to be all the errors.\nWe extract the school column based on a similar method, of identifying the school tag on the NGA site. However, some governors like Kenneth Hood Mackay attended college but don’t have an NGA tag for it. We did not attempt to locate the set of governors who attended college but didn’t have a dedicated school tag on their NGA site, so we are likely underestimating the number of governors who attended college.\n\n\n\nKenneth Hood Mackay’s NGA page where he has no school listed in the table.\n\n\nThe birth_date and school columns are instructive examples of how even reliable websites backed with institutional authority can make mistakes with data entry. Those data entry mistakes can propagate into resources like this, whose quality is only ever as good as the underlying source."

We track the share of governors with law degrees as a simple proxy for how “professionalized” the office is. Law has long been a standard path into politics–lawyers gain legal expertise and entry into elite social networks. The share rises through the mid-19th century and then plateaus. Since roughly 2000, it declines modestly, consistent with more governors coming from business and other non-law fields.\n\n\nCode\n## Let's look at rate of governors with law degrees\nyearly_lawyer &lt;- gov_long %&gt;%\n    group_by(year) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n        total = n(),\n        lawyer = sum(lawyer == 1, na.rm = TRUE),\n        pct_lawyer = 100 * lawyer / total,\n        .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n\n# 2.

Generating features for tabular data out of web-scraped text is challenging and imperfect. But, efforts like this help us notice demographic trends among US governors, and we’ve pointed out a couple interesting results around gender, professionalization, and governor age. We think future work could refine our methods and extend them to other offices, to help complete a more full picture of the history of American government."

Are there similar traits between the top states?\n\n\nExercise 2\nLet’s now look at the initial age for governors and the distribution. We already visualized the average starting age in the main data essay, but let’s look at the distribution across the entire dataframe\nFirst, let’s cut the age_at_start variable into bins, so people between ages 20 and 30 get mapped to 20, 30 and 40 to 30 etc. Let’s call this new column age_bucket. We will use the Pandas function pd.cut.\nNow let’s display the value_counts of the age_bucket column and let’s sort by the age.\nYour code here\nDiscuss/consider: Which age range has the most governors?\n\n\nExercise 3:\nLet’s look at the outlier governors who started office at or below the age of 30. Let’s filter the dataset down to this set by filtering on the age_at_start column, call it young_governors and display it.\nYour code here\nDiscuss/consider: Who are the youngest governors in American History? What era are they from? Take a look at some of their Wikipedia pages and NGA biographies online."

    "text": "Metadata Analysis\n\nBy Aashna Sheth\nLet’s start by reading our data into a pandas dataframe. A pandas dataframe is a structure used to hold file data. This structure has efficient methods used for manipulating and visualizing data.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context/refs/heads/main/datasets/top-500-novels/top-500-novels-metadata_2025-01-11.csv\", sep=',', header=0, low_memory=False)\n\n\nNow, we can answer various questions using this structure, which we’ve named df.\nFor example, let’s look at counts related to author gender and name.\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"author_gender\"].value_counts(dropna=False)\n\n\nauthor_gender\nmale      355\nfemale    145\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nWe see that about 70% of authors on the list are male and 30% are female.\nSome authors appear multiple times on the list. Let’s see which authors are most represented in the list.\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"author\"].value_counts(dropna=False).head(10)\n\n\nauthor\nJohn Grisham            19\nCharles Dickens         15\nJohn Steinbeck           8\nC.S.

Rowling             7\nErnest Hemingway         5\nJames Patterson          5\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nNext, we can delve into some visualization work to understand where authors are from and what timeframe of publication is most represented in the top 500 list.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\nbins = np.arange(1000, 2060, 50)\nbars = df['pub_year'].plot.hist(bins=bins, edgecolor='w')\nplt.xticks(rotation='vertical');\nplt.xticks(bins);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that most books on the list were published between 1950 and 2000. Let’s take a look at information about the oldest and newest books on the list.\n\n\nCode\nfrom IPython.display import display\n\nprint(\"Oldest Book(s):\")\ndisplay(df[df[\"pub_year\"]==df[\"pub_year\"].min()])\nprint(\"Newest Book(s):\")\ndisplay(df[df[\"pub_year\"]==df[\"pub_year\"].max()])\n\n\nOldest Book(s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_500_rank\ntitle\nauthor\npub_year\norig_lang\ngenre\nauthor_birth\nauthor_death\nauthor_gender\nauthor_primary_lang\n...\ngr_num_ratings\ngr_num_reviews\ngr_avg_rating_rank\ngr_num_ratings_rank\noclc_owi\nauthor_viaf\ngr_url\nwiki_url\npg_eng_url\npg_orig_url\n\n\n\n\n137\n138\nThe Tale of Genji\nMurasaki Shikibu\n1021\nJapanese\nna\n978?\n1016?\nfemale\njpn\n...\n13,275\n1,385\n430\n477\n4.739790e+09\n95154208.0\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7042.The_T...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/66057/pg6...\nunavailable\n\n\n\n\n1 rows × 29 columns\n\n\n\nNewest Book(s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_500_rank\ntitle\nauthor\npub_year\norig_lang\ngenre\nauthor_birth\nauthor_death\nauthor_gender\nauthor_primary_lang\n...\ngr_num_ratings\ngr_num_reviews\ngr_avg_rating_rank\ngr_num_ratings_rank\noclc_owi\nauthor_viaf\ngr_url\nwiki_url\npg_eng_url\npg_orig_url\n\n\n\n\n401\n402\nThe Girl on the Train\nPaula Hawkins\n2015\nEnglish\nna\n1972\nALIVE\nfemale\neng\n...\n2,924,281\n126,289\n275\n26\n1.893823e+09\n14277202.0\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-t...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_on_the_...\nNA_not-pub-domain\nNaN\n\n\n480\n481\nGo Set a Watchman\nHarper Lee\n2015\nEnglish\nna\n1926\n2016\nfemale\neng\n...\n272,837\n32,622\n498\n209\n2.283979e+09\n12431460.0\nNaN\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Set_a_Watchman\nNA_not-pub-domain\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n2 rows × 29 columns\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at where the authors are from!\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"author_nationality\"].value_counts().head(5)\n\n\nauthor_nationality\nUS    257\nGB    149\nFR     27\nRU     10\nDE     10\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s unpack the differences between the Goodreads ratings and the top 500 ratings. First, we should think about how we want to compare the two lists. Given that we have listed rankings by average rating and number of ratings, which metric would be better to use? Would we want to create another metric?\nFor our purposes, we decided to use number of ratings, instead of average rating, as OCLC measures popularity by number of holdings, not how much patrons say they enjoy reading the books.\n\n\nCode\ndef top_5_comparison(col_name):\n  print(df[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\n  sorted = df.sort_values(by=[col_name])\n  print(sorted[[\"title\", \"author\", \"top_500_rank\", col_name]].head(5))\n\ntop_5_comparison(\"gr_num_ratings_rank\")\n\n\n                                title                  author  top_500_rank  \\\n0                         Don Quixote     Miguel de Cervantes             1   \n1    Alice's Adventures in Wonderland           Lewis Carroll             2   \n2  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn              Mark Twain             3   \n3        The Adventures of Tom Sawyer              Mark Twain             4   \n4                     Treasure Island  Robert Louis Stevenson             5   \n\n   gr_num_ratings_rank  \n0                  211  \n1                  133  \n2                   68  \n3                   88  \n4                  145  \n                                     title               author  top_500_rank  \\\n44   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone         J.K.
