# How have visits to a particular National Park changed over time?

# Exercise 1: First, filter the dataframe for the park of your choice

my_parks_df <- 

# Exercise 2: Now, make a line plot that shows the number of visits per year to that park from 1979 to 2022
# Choose a color for the line
# Give the plot a title that also functions as a kind of "headline" for the most interesting story of the plot

# When you're done, drop the plot into our Discord server!
