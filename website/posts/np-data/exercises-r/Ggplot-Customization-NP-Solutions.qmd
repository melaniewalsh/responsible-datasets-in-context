## Load National Park Visitation data
```{r}
np_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/1979-2022-National-Park-Visits-By-State.csv",
 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

View the np_data dataframe by clicking on the spreadsheet icon in the Global Environment

## Load libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
library("dplyr")
library("stringr")
library("ggplot2")
library("scales")
```

- How have visits to a particular National Park changed over time?
- What is the most interesting period of change?

# Exercise 1
First, filter the dataframe for a park of your choice. Then, pick a National Park that you haven't worked with yet, and filter the data for only that park.

```{r}
my_parks_df <- np_data %>% 
  filter(ParkName == "Mount Rainier NP")

head(my_parks_df)  
```

# Exercise 2

Now, make a line plot that shows the number of visits per year to that park from 1979 to 2022.  

### 2a.
Choose a color for the line.  

### 2b.
Give the plot a title that also functions as a kind of "headline" for the most interesting story of the plot.  

### 2c.
Change the x-axis ticks so that they increase 5 years at a time. 

### 2d.
Change the y-axis tick labels so that they abbreviate millions to M and thousands to K.  


```{r} 
ggplot(my_parks_df) +
  geom_line(aes(
    x = Year,
    y = RecreationVisits
  ),
  color = "green") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = 1980, to = 2020, by = 5),
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),
  limits = c(0, 2000000)) +
  labs(title = "Visits to Mt. Rainier Are Surprisingly Stable")

```

## Exercise 3

Now, create a plot that zooms in on the most interesting time period for this particular National Park.  

### 3a. 
Change the x-axis limits so that it only shows the most interesting years.

### 3b. 
Come up with a new title that describes this time period. 


```{r}
ggplot(my_parks_df) +
  geom_line(aes(
    x = Year,
    y = RecreationVisits
  ),
  color = "green") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = 1980, to = 2020, by = 5), 
    limits = c(2005, 2023),
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),
   limits = c(0, 2000000)) +
  labs(title = "After a COVID Dip, Mt. Rainier Visits Are Higher Than Ever")
```
