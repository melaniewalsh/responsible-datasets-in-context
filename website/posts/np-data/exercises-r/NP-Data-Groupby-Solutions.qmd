# Load the data

```{r} 
np_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/1979-2020-National-Park-Visits-By-State.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Load dplyr library
```{r warning="ignore"} 
library("dplyr")
```
# Exercise 1

What is the average number of visits for *each state*?

Save as `avg_state_visits` and then view the resulting dataframe.

```{r} 
avg_state_visits <- np_data %>% 
                    group_by(State) %>%
                    summarize(avg_visits = mean(RecreationVisits))
```

Discuss/consider: What state has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?

# Exercise 2
What is the average number of visits for *each National Park*?

Save as `avg_park_visits` and then view the resulting dataframe.

```{r} 
avg_park_visits <- np_data %>% 
                    group_by(ParkName, State) %>%
                    summarize(avg_visits = mean(RecreationVisits))
```

Discuss/consider: Which National Park has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?

# Exercise 3: 
How many National Parks are there in *each state*?

Save your answer as `distinct_parks`.

```{r} 
distinct_parks <-   np_data %>% 
                    group_by(State) %>%
                    summarize(num_parks = n_distinct(ParkName))
```

Discuss/consider: What state has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?
