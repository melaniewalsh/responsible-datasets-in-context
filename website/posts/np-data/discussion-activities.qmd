# Discussion & Activities {#discussion-and-activities}

## Activity 1 

It is inevitable that the devices that the National Park Service uses to count visits to the parks — like induction loop counters installed on the road — will break. But they will also get *fixed* at different rates, in different locations, as we could see in the case of Crater Lake National Park (where a counter was fixed quickly) and Carlsbad Caverns National Park (where a broken counter from 2019 still has not been fixed).

There are many reasons for these disparities, but some of the big ones might be geography and resources. The more remote a park, the harder it is to get a repair team to it. The less-resourced a park, the lower the likelihood they have on-site repair teams, or are prioritized by the repair teams that can be dispatched.

With this in mind, look at the locations of the following parks. Suppose that each one has an outage in their induction loop counter: which ones would you expect to be fixed first, and why? Research the parks, and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being highest, and 5 being lowest) of which would be fixed quickest.

| Park               | Priority (1-5) | Reason |
|--------------------|----------------|--------|
| Acadia NP          |                |        |
| Lassen Volcanic NP |                |        |
| Saguaro NP         |                |        |
| Yosemite NP        |                |        |
| Mammoth Cave NP    |                |        |

## Activity 2 
The National Park Service sometimes fills in missing data with hard numbers or approximates data by applying special mathematical formulas. This is necessary work, but it is also under-explained work.

To see this in action, go to [the NPS page that documents park reports](https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park) and down the "Visitor Use Counting Procedures" PDF for three different parks.

How are the procedures for these three parks similar or different? What kind of effect do you think this has on the resulting data? What do you think is the best of documenting this information and communicating it to users of the data?

## Activity 3

In 2014 and 2015, Kobuk Valley National Park reported that there were zero visitors to the park.

Use publicly available internet data - Twitter posts, Flickr photos, etc - to try and find evidence of people visiting the park (there is existing evidence!). 

Based on your findings, how do you think, differently, if at all, about Kobuk Valley's decision to record zero visits and about alternative methods for counting visits?
