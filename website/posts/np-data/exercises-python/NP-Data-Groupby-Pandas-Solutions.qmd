# Load the data

```python
import pandas as pd

np_data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/1979-2020-National-Park-Visits-By-State.csv")
```

# Exercise 1

What is the average number of visits for *each state*?

Save as `avg_state_visits` and then view the resulting dataframe.

```python
avg_state_visits = np_data.groupby('State')['RecreationVisits'].mean().reset_index()
avg_state_visits
```

Discuss/consider: What state has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?

# Exercise 2

What is the average number of visits for *each National Park*?

Save as `avg_park_visits` and then view the resulting dataframe.

```python
avg_park_visits = np_data.groupby('ParkName')['RecreationVisits'].mean().reset_index()
avg_park_visits
```

Discuss/consider: Which National Park has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?

# Exercise 3: 

How many National Parks are there in *each state*?

Save your answer as `distinct_parks`.

```python
distinct_parks = np_data.groupby('State')['ParkName'].nunique().reset_index(name='NumParks')
distinct_parks
```

Discuss/consider: What state has the most and least average visits? What patterns or surprises do you notice?
