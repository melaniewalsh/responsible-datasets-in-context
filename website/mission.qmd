# ðŸš§ Mission Under Construction  ðŸš§ 

We are opposed to treating datasets like grab-and-go fast food, or like random meat to be stuffed into a machine learning algorithm's grinder. We promote the slow curation of data and the careful evaluation and understanding of data.

In this project, we also highlight the importance of the following:

- Challenging Received Knowledge

- Engaging Communities

- Producing Counterdata

- Resisting Data Extraction
