# Responsible Datasets in Context

This website hosts a repository of curated datasets that are paired with rich documentation, related essays, and teaching resources. Through these resources, we provide models for responsible data curation, documentation, story-telling, and analysis. 

We do so by:

* Digging into each dataset's **social and historical context.** 
* Investigating each dataset's **provenance, flaws, and limitations.**
* Hosting each dataset as an interactive, explorable data table.
* Pairing each dataset with teaching resourcesâ€”such as **programming exercises**, **discussion questions**, and **activites.**

Learn more about our [Datasets](datasets.qmd), [Team](team.qmd), [Mission](mission.qmd), and [Sponsors](sponsors.qmd). Check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context) or [get in touch](get-in-touch.qmd).

<!-- 
By providing these contextual materials, we hope to promote the responsible use of these particular datasets for teaching and research in humanities and data science contexts. We also seek to promote the responsible use of data more broadlyâ€”whether in the classroom, industry, or the wider worldâ€”by underscoring the significance of context in all data-related work. -->
