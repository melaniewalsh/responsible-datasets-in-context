The course first focused on a localized perspective in this transborder region before shifting to a broader U.S. and global perspective. \n\nFor over thirty years, the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua bordering Texas and New Mexico have experienced and witnessed multiple forms of violence across its rural and urban regions. Communities are besieged with cartels and gender-based violence, and the saturation of international corporations that pay workers less than livable wages for workers in Ciudad Juárez. An overwhelming amount of attention has focused on Ciudad Juárez for cases of feminicide pointing to the early 1990s as a period when families of disappeared and murdered women, activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and national and international human rights regimes clamored over the hundreds of women and girls who disappeared and were never found, or whose remains were located near or within Ciudad Juárez (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Lagarde y de los Ríos, 2010; Driver, 2015; Lozano, 2019). Concentrated attention was given to the feminicides at that time, but over the years, less focus has been given to the galvanizing efforts of local people to demand responses from authorities to resolve these atrocities. (From Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nDespite the increased social awareness, local community activism, formation of local organizations and nonprofits, and foreign academic interventions—there is still no satisfactory response from Mexican authorities regarding Mexican feminicidios. Among the notable and progressive changes that have occurred to bring justice to the murdered women and girls is the legal classification of feminicide, or _feminicidio_, as Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos coined and inserted into Mexican legal framework, which she co-proposed and co-created (Monárrez Fregoso, Rosa-Linda, and Bejarano 2020). The term femicide emerged from Diana Russell and Jill Radford’s _Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing _(1992), which proposed a feminist approach in addressing the disproportionate killing of women by differentiating these murders from general homicides. Although the direct translation of femicide to Spanish is _femicidio_, Lagarde y de los Ríos argued that it was not enough to classify these murders as separate from homicide; thus, she coined _feminicidio_. By naming feminicide, _feminicidio_, Lagarde y de los Ríos expanded on the definition of femicide to “name the ensemble of violations of women’s human rights, which contain the crimes against and the disappearances of women” (2020). The term feminicidio acknowledges that the killing of women is an institutional and systemic violence, meaning that feminicidios occur because of the authorities’ omission, negligence, and/or collusion with the assailants which inhibits women’s access to justice and thereby contributes to impunity.\n\nYet, even with the legal designation of _feminicidios_ as a form of institutional gender violence, there is much work to be done. Many well-meaning (and sometimes, not so well-meaning) works of art, novels, and films have inadvertently contributed to sensationalizing Ciudad Juárez’s feminicides (Driver 2015). Rather than garnering awareness as intended, some of these media formats have fallen into entertainment categories, further dehumanizing these women and girls’ deaths. With this precedent, it is essential to mention that local community members, such as the victims’ mothers, family members, academics, journalists, and many others in the region and in different parts of the world have been actively archiving and collecting data regarding the feminicides.  (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nPeople in Chihuahua and the greater border region have engaged in transnational movements to stop gender-based violence by implementing diverse data and record-keeping processes to hold state systems accountable. Everyday people played an active role in pursuing justice in response to backlogged and slow-moving justice systems and negligent authorities working within crumbling infrastructures, which caused other forms of violence against feminicide victims’ families when state systems blamed, ignored, or outright rejected families’ demands to solve these crimes. Families, activists, and human rights defenders were confronted by misogynistic and hyper-patriarchal practices by authorities who perpetuated these ideologies, thus, working ineffectively to end feminicides. Some were inept or even fearful of resolving these crimes, subsequently, exhibiting a dereliction of duty by failing to keep accurate data-keeping files (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Driver, 2015; Bejarano, 2023). \n\nFeminist activists, digital activists, activist-scholars, and everyday people world-wide are vigorously working to engage in data-keeping mobilizations to document and protest feminicides and gender-based violence. These data-keeping resistance movements collect data to contest the intersectional violence that authorities create and foment. Feminist data projects galvanize record-keeping efforts to maintain and even recover data and make visible the extent of gender-based violence in communities across the Global South and Global North. There are several prominent feminist data projects documenting gender-based violence in existence across the Americas. These projects primarily focus on data that is counting feminicides from specific BIPOC women’s groups or regions, and visualizing these crimes through spreadsheets, repositories, and other forms of digital visualizations such as maps and infographics. Collectively, the data from these projects have served the anti-feminicide movement as tools to counter the erasure or minimization of feminicides that authorities will often claim. Of these nine data projects listed below, we will discuss the first three listed in detail, as they are digital public-facing projects that focus on cases of gender-violence and feminicide in Cd. Juarez. Digital projects like Ellas Tienen Nombre and Ecos del Desierto and archival collections like the Ester Cano Chavez Collection are powerful examples of how civil society organizations, everyday people, and families take the responsibility of collecting this feminist data and doing the work of the authorities. They provide transparency and an unofficial record of data with the use of digital technologies and collaborative practices with professionals in libraries and archival studies, visual studies, geographical information systems, web developers, and other allies. Thus, these types of resources provide a digital record with critical data that impacts the lives of many families and serves as a tool to seek justice. (From Fernandez Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nActivism, whether it stems from academic institutions, art forms, or through other representations, need to be done ethically, especially since feminicides are a global systemic occurrence and not only occur in the U.S./Mexico border cities. Through the “Border Women” course projects, students approached digital tools, data, and the course’s sensitive topics with the intention of not replicating the same colonial research practices referenced and studied as a class as well as using a humanities-based approach to gender violence data. Since some forms of feminicide awareness decenter the focus of gender violence away from the women and girls themselves, it is necessary that students not only read about and discuss the ethics of gender violence data, but also apply these methodologies and confront these ethical questions through creating their own digital projects. \n\n\n## COURSE INTRODUCTION\n\nIn Fall 2023 with the support of the “Responsible Computing Challenge” of the Mozilla Foundation, with the Responsible Datasets in Context Project,  the undergraduate course “Border Women Literature and Feminist Cartography” to be revised and be offered to students from Data Science, History, English, Political Science, Spanish and Film and Media Studies from the Honor’s College  and the College of Liberal and Fine Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\n The course was offered as a special topic, interdisciplinary, collaborative and experiment-driven, where students explore and critically analyze a selected group of border women’s literary texts, archival material, oral histories, digital projects with datasets and databases of counterdata (D’Ignazio 2024) that addressed gender-based and related violence and feminicides at the US-Mexico border and other parts of the world. Through a close and distant reading analysis students enhance in the development of multilingual humanities datasets to explore a series of thematical feminist cartographies through transnational, intersectional, antiracist, geographical and historical frameworks. Additionally, students explore various methods and digital tools and software with public datasets to convert these excerpts into a series of informative critical data visualizations.\n\nThroughout the course, relevant social, historical, cultural readings, digital material, visual aids, interviews and workshops with writers, critics, activists, project creators and data specialists were included to help students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Overall, students engage in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing at the intersection of feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping and data science.\n\n\n\n![Poster of Responsable and Ethical Digital Memory Making in the Context of Crossborder Gender Violence & Femenicide](images/poster-image1.jpg \"Poster Image\")\n_Image 1. Poster presented by the course instructors at the Academic Data Science Alliance on October 24-27, 2023 at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Data Science School._\n\n\n## COURSE ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW\n\nThe course was divided into five modules and the final module. In every module the students had the opportunity to engage in different forms of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data from different sources, with various digital tools and through multiple scenarios. \n\n\n\n* **Module #1 _Heridas abiertasà Mapeando nuestras identidades: _**Introduction to main concepts: Intersectionality, border identities, feminist and mapping practices.\n\n    \n\n\n\n![Identity and Intersectionality visualization using Miro](images/miro-visualization-image2.png \"Identity and Intersectionality visualization\")\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n![Anastasia Sasha Krouk Blanco comment on Identity and Intersectionality visualization she made](images/visualization-comment-image3.png \"nastasia Sasha Krouk Blanco comment on visualization\")\n_Image 2.

Every team was tasked with a different form of approaching data, thus deciding on a methodology that will work best under the scenario they faced. Throughout this process they encountered several challenges that exposed them work with missing, uncontextualized, wrong data, data in other languages than English, the digital divide, the pre-digital age, lack of information in the digital cultural record, and the need to do field work or work closely with individuals, community members or organizations involved. Additionally, they had great observations of future work that can be done with these datasets or to make this data more accessible in other platforms to better serve those who are advocating for justice in the public and political level, as well as to expand the research on this data of counting feminicides and human rights movements. \n\n\n\n* **Dataset #1: _[Tracing Feminicides in El Paso, Texas Using the Hispanic-American Newspaper Newsbank-Readex Collection](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/ERRyEGE0CLtCpx2UwXke8hgBA-WigVSJKZz6E7iSB_EvkA?e=5dUC0k)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jessica Corona (Leader), Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, & Sara Mosher</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/ERRyEGE0CLtCpx2UwXke8hgBA-WigVSJKZz6E7iSB_EvkA?e=5dUC0k)**\n    * **Dataset description: **Since the beginning of society in the United States, stereotypes and representations of women have been created to oppress them. Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\n    * **Dataset dissemination:** mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n* **Dataset #2: _[Digital and Translated Version of \"El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio\" Printed Spreadsheet](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc)_**\n    * **Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille</span>**\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset. \n    * **Dataset dissemination: **visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n* **Dataset #3: _[Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EbmXffhLIvNClcOd_Mzl_PcBE8k0G6dwgQlvheM_FX7xFQ?e=lpoirv)_**\n    * Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, </span>Kiri Avelar, & <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Paris Cantu</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EbmXffhLIvNClcOd_Mzl_PcBE8k0G6dwgQlvheM_FX7xFQ?e=lpoirv)**\n    * **Dataset Description:** The project's purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were _Woman Hollering Creek_ (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and _The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories _(1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from _Woman Hollering Creek_ and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in _The Mystery of Survival_. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from _Woman Hollering Creek_ and _The Mystery of Survival_, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the \\\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters' experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between _Woman Hollering Creek_ and _The Mystery of Survival_ as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\n    * **Dataset dissemination:** mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n* **Dataset #4: _[Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ed5N9T-imoNNgKv2VBVDfNQBbLQwjHmvYXOR0s9XNZdZeQ?e=5CM5Jz)_**\n    * **Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla</span>**, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ed5N9T-imoNNgKv2VBVDfNQBbLQwjHmvYXOR0s9XNZdZeQ?e=5CM5Jz)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected. Though we are still predominantly shining our light on women and gender-based violence, we found other marginalized communities that can have their messages shared. Films like _Killers of the Flower Moon_ showcase violence based on the Osage community and other similar native American communities, and Milk which shows an openly gay politician fighting to break out of the glass ceiling. These films, though show \\\ndifferent variations and levels of violence, intersectionality of present, it shows the trials these marginalized communities have faced. While engaged in the data collection and analysis we wanted to highlight these stories as well as leave it strictly to gender-based violence toward women. At the end, the dataset evolved and can be defined into four main takeaways/themes: personification of violence, definitions of violence, representation of genre, and missing stories. The first takeaway was the personification of violence; breaking this down into the on-screen, almost jarring reality of the possible glorification, stylization, and informative analysis of violence on screen. Our team felt that many of the films listed on the dataset could be argued and grouped into any one of the said narratives. This allows the audience to further their own definitions of gender violence in film. This does lead to the next takeaway, definitions. Throughout the construction of the dataset, we noticed a common theme with films depicting gender violence and/or having a main plot point be that of gendered violence. Many of the films listed are defined and categorized as “romances”. Films like _Urban Cowboy_, _I_, _Tonya_, and _Lolita_ are all defined as romances; all these films depict graphic scenes of abuse, both physical and mental. Our question as a group is how does depicting and defining this film impact viewers? Are they glorifying? Are they stylizing? Are they informing? Our third takeaway was the cross-representation of genre. The dataset is broad - it includes films, biopics, documentaries, docuseries, horror, historical dramas, science fiction, and many more. We discovered that genre can be a visual but also narrative aid and representation with overall thematic analysis in relation to a film. Many of the films that we listed focused on and outlined meaningful, non-voyeuristic representational work on the issue of violence against women. All the films, across genres, in most ways, were symbolic of violating the heteronormative values of women and other marginalized groups in media; all following the steppingstones of action, resistance, and retribution. The last takeaway was the missing stories that we, as a group, found that were absent after completing the dataset. Again, it is a broad dataset, but there are still not enough individual, personal stories being represented. Many of our films fall under two categories: white, cis-female representation and wide-releases in English-speaking countries. There is a gap in our data that we must be aware of for the future of the dataset. The stories these films captured span from 1918 to the present, but there are still missing stories, missing people who need to be heard through the media of film.\n    * **Dataset dissemination: **app, visualizations, image analysis, digital repository and digital exhibit\n* **Dataset #5: _[Books and Articles from Mexico and the U.S. Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EeZ2sbQ96GJNhqHVMzF9tZUByPzNOhcozSshn6dqJjLiNA?e=SoagHc)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jared Pond (Leader), Emily Malloy (Leader), Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, & Ambonnay Rodriguez</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EeZ2sbQ96GJNhqHVMzF9tZUByPzNOhcozSshn6dqJjLiNA?e=SoagHc)**\n    * **Dataset Description:<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>**This dataset project was to call attention to feminicide and gender violence in scholarly literature. We wanted to show that these women are remembered and were failed by their society and protectors. To make people uncomfortable enough to understand the seriousness of this topic, and to show that there are people keeping track and those who care. Our dataset tracks information on pieces of scholarly literature primarily from the U.S. and Mexico that relate to femicide and gender violence. This dataset can be used to compare the types of literature and how it is represented across different publishing houses and countries. And the noticeable absence of information from publishing houses in Mexico. Some of our findings include the trait of Chicano, Hispanic, and Mexican authors publishing in areas other than Mexico, leading to the question of how much, and how hard the government and society itself tries to hide this violence. For example, some of the first books touching on these topics like _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra_ or _Cosecha de Mujeres_ had trouble finding a publisher and had even issues with some editors in charge.  Our limitations included: authors not being on the internet, authors being hidden by other authors' articles by other interpretations, and not being able to fully investigate and read every single piece of literature we listed. We also understand that we did not incorporate as many essays, articles, and books as there are in other databases as well. The next step for this project is to keep expanding on these works in any way possible. Those who work on this dataset may be able to make more connections between the data than we were able to see as their background knowledge is different than ours; or maybe even more resources than we do. We also recognize that we are missing data and possibly have inaccuracies, but it’s clear that femicide has become more apparent globally and is something that nobody should be quiet about. \n* **Dataset #6: _[Murals and Public Monuments Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EX7_WITUvZVPhcbk0c-dsXUBfdtoDdsMeU610vx_W7dnUw?e=MXlHGt)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nilou Esmaeili (Leader), Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EX7_WITUvZVPhcbk0c-dsXUBfdtoDdsMeU610vx_W7dnUw?e=MXlHGt)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **For this final dataset project, as a group we scavenged data pertaining to murals and monuments placed throughout Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, other various cities throughout Mexico, and internationally. The purpose of this dataset is to hopefully bring awareness to how frequently gender-based violence occurs especially in hotspots such as areas around the US-Mexican border, throughout Mexican cities, other countries of more conservative nature, more populated countries, etc... The list can go on, but the point is, that gender-based violence happens worldwide every day whether we witness it or not. Most of the data sources were from social media sites such as Instagram and X (Twitter). We encountered that when scrolling through these applications, there are a lot of bots, inappropriate content, threats, and unrelated posts. It was frustrating because social media is a good source to pull current information and data from, but navigating was annoying. Originally, our purpose would’ve been to create a program (code) to help the team members easily navigate and pick out the data needed throughout the loads of data and posts we go through on articles and social media sites. Unfortunately, it requires more advanced coding skills to create this program because it utilizes AI databases and even creating databases for the AI coding working with this data requires field work to process this data. Student comment: “I encounter having to interact with data in a way I have not even begun learning nor brushed up on in any of my classes. For reasons such as that, I scrapped my program completely and just manually mined data for our project. It would’ve been a nice way to make it easier for not only me and my groupmates, but my other classmates to use.” \n    * **Dataset dissemination: **mapping, image analysis, digital and 3D exhibits, virtual reality\n\n## INTRODUCTION TO: “DATASET #2: DIGITAL AND TRANSLATED VERSION OF \"EL SILENCIO DE LA VOZ QUE A TODOS NOS QUIEBRA FEMINICIDIO\" PRINTED SPREADSHEET”\n\n\n## ABOUT THE DATASET FINAL PROJECT\n\nAs part of the assigned reading material, students read _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra: Mujeres y Víctimas de Ciudad Juárez_ by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez). This text was published by Ediciones del Azar A.C. in November of 1999, with 1001 issues distributed and no edited version created after. It was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with the emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This text wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, the group decided to model their project with humanization at the forefront.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Front page of the book _El silencio que la voz de todas_](images/el-silencio-que-la-voz-de-todas-image14.png \"Front page of the book _El silencio que la voz de todas_\")\n\n\n_Image 8. The front page of the book, El silencio que la de todas quiebra._\n\nAt the end of the [book](https://elperiodicodelassenoras.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/benitez-silencio-voz-todas-quiebra.pdf), the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Unfortunately, the digital copy that is available online as a PDF file does not include the complete spreadsheet. During the class, the professors had students access to a copy of the completed printed spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Map created by authors mapping all the cases included in the spreadsheet](images/cases-map-image15.png \"Map visualization of all cases included in the spreadsheet\")\n\n\n_Image 9. A hands-on map created by the authors mapping all the cases included in the spreadsheet. This map is available at the end of El Silencio._\n\n\n\n\n\n![Part one of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case](images/spreadsheet-part1-image16.png \"Part one of the spreadsheet at the end of the book\")\n\n\n\n\n![Part two of the spreadsheet at the end of the book with total cases and metadata for each case](images/spreadsheet-part2-image17.png \"Part two of the spreadsheet at the end of the book\")\n\n\n_Image 10 & 11. The spreadsheet included at the end of the book with a total of 137 cases and metadata related to each case._\n\nThis spreadsheet is only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Currently, there is a scanned version circulating on the internet, but the spreadsheet is not complete, and the printed book is not on sale anymore and it requires a special process to request the book from libraries that have a copy. Therefore, our group was tasked to:\n\n\n\n1.  Make this dataset digitally accessible by transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. \n2. Translate this dataset from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data.\n3. Include digitized, digital born or digital sources related to the cases documented in this dataset. \n\nThis latter was intended to contribute current information on the web by finding articles and pictures of the victims mentioned to highlight the person rather than the case's details. Though it was tough to find information on all of the women, the team found a couple links that have been included in the digital dataset. We followed the same categories listed on the original spreadsheet. We also created a different tab for the English version on the same spreadsheet, as we thought it would be the best way to organize the data for side by side comparisons. This was the information translated and included in the digital dataset in Spanish and English, nothing was modified from the original, except some duplicate cases that were altered when formatting the spreadsheet to fit the book format. \n\nDataset Link: [Bilingual Database of El Silencio de la Voz (Copy).xlsx](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc) \n\n\n## WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM? WHO COLLECTED IT?\n\n\n### Dataset Translation & Digitization\n\nA group of undergraduate students at the University of Texas at San Antonio digitized and translated the original feminicide dataset provided by _El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra_ as part of Honor’s course, “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” (Fall 2023) taught by Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla and Paulina Hernández-Trejo. This group of undergraduate students were Jasbeth Medrano (Political Science), Carolina Vlaun (English), Judith Ordonez (Film and Media), Alex Sanchez (Computer Science), and Samuel Friedrich (Kinesiology).\n\n\n### Original Dataset Authors\n\nThe data came from a dataset that was included at the end of the book, _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra_, by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz, who worked together to collect the data and created the dataset and map previously shown in Image 9 and 10. The authors of _El Silencio_ compiled this dataset and published it in 1999. Besides the dataset, _El Silencio_ intentionally humanizes some of the women and girls that are in the dataset through testimonios of their mothers and family members. According to its introduction chapter, _El Silencio’s_ larger objective would not just be the contribution of this ample feminicide dataset, but rather an intimate encounter between the testimonies of the victims’ mothers and the data itself. _El Silencio’s_ authors wanted this encounter to show how these _feminicidios_ imply a larger systemic violence against women, one that we are all accountable for creating in the way we control women.\n\nThis text does not feature any of the perpetrators or suspects, aligning with its objective of highlighting the lives, not the deaths, of these women and girls. Thus, _El Silencio_ highlights the lives of Erendira, Sagrario, Olga Alicia, Elizabeth, Adriana, Silvia Elena, and Argelia in detail in between the chapters discussing the creation of the dataset. As the authors reiterate, Ciudad Juárez “should be remembered not only for its feminicides, but also for its women who live a common life, perhaps like our own, one like your mother, your sister or your daughter....the victims should never be considered ‘the problem’ or stigmatized for their deaths; the silence, self-censorship, complicity, and negligence are what should outrage and shame us” (6). \n\n\n## WHY WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? HOW IS THE DATA USED?\n\nOriginally the data was collected under the lack of response from the Mexican authorities, the United States government to take seriously the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua and its surroundings since the early 1900s.  Under this situation, the mothers, family members, activists, human rights defender and others have worked individually and collectively to learn best ways to gather information to fight for justice, policy changes and to work on the different cases that have not been solved. In this case, the original spreadsheet of _El Silencio_ was created by the authors of this book, as they were writers and journalists working for local newspapers (_El Diario _and _El Norte_) in Cd. Juarez where they started to get together to collect the data of missing and murdered cases since 1990 through newspapers reports, government reports and then corroborating with some of the mothers and family members through their testimonios. This spreadsheet was one of the first ones that accounts to the feminicides in Cd. Juarez and its surroundings in the early 90s when these cases started to have national and international attention. This data has been used for legal cases and for further investigation of the cases documented, as well as for other activists and scholars to continue advocating from justice in physical and digital spaces through initiatives that keep track of this counterdata of feminicides (D’Ignazio, 2024). Some examples are: \n\n\n\n1. Accountant and founder of Casa Amiga, Esther Chavez Cano, who collected all the newspapers and documents of cases of feminicides. Part of the collection was donated to [Special Collection in New Mexico State University](https://nmarchives.unm.edu/repositories/18/resources/1270), the rest is in Casa Amiga. \n2. Activist and professor Julia Monarrez, author of _[Trama de una Injusticia: Feminicidio Sexual Sistémico en Ciudad Juárez](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/Trama_de_una_injusticia_feminicidio_sexu/V-eDAgAAQBAJ?hl=es-419&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)_, who has been working on a database with detailed information of cases in the 90s and more recently.\n3. Activist Ivonne Ramirez, creator of [Ellas Tienen Nombre](https://www.ellastienennombre.org/), who worked on a database of feminicides from 1993 to the present and visualized them in a digital map.  \n\nFor the “Border Women and Feminist Cartography” (Fall 2023) course, the printed spreadsheet of _El Silencio_ was chosen to be translated into English and was created into a digital spreadsheet with additional information found in the digital record in order for a larger audience to have access to this data in a digital platform and for non-Spanish speakers.  The selection to make this spreadsheet created in the 90s in a digital and bilingual format is due to the generational divide since the issues of feminicides in the border region have been happening during an era that other digital tools and technologies were used and in the present there is a need to update these materials with current digital platforms and technologies to advance the processing and accessibility of previous data work done outside of academia or government institutions.  \n\n\n## WHAT’S IN THE DATA? \n\nA chronology of the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez from 1993 to 1998. In English and Spanish each dataset contains specific details of each case (137 in total) such as:\n\n\n\n* Expediente (Case number)\n* Edad (Age)\n* Nombre (Name)\n* Hallada (Date found)\n* Desapareció (Datails of disappearance)\n* Lugar de Hallazgo (Place found)\n* Características Físicas (Physical characteristics)\n* Datos de su Vida (Facts About the Victim's Life)\n* Causa de Muerte (Cause of death)\n* Caracteristicas de muerte: posición, Estado (Characteristics of Death: position, state)\n* Detalles Vestimenta (Clothing Details)\n* Presunto(s), responsable(s) (Potential Attackers)\n* Caso (case)\n* Datos Incongruentes (Incongruencies)\n* Artículos (Articles)\n* Fotos (Photos)\n* Notas (Notes)\n\n\n## HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\n\nThe data was collected through research in newspapers reporting the cases, testimonios with the mothers and family members, and through, authorities reports and other legal documents.  By consulting and researching from various sources, Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez) were putting the data of each case together in order to have a more complete image of each case. \n\nFor this project, the new data included was through web research to include digital news reports about cases published locally and internationally. Similarly, the translation to English was meticulously done in order to choose the words that best represent the meanings in Spanish considering how activists and those involved in the movement have determine certain words and specification to avoid the dehumanization of these women. With this in mind, any image or article on the internet that reinforced the interpretation of these cases as death bodies, pieces of body or disposable bodies was not included. Thus, the proceed of making this dataset in a digital and bilingual format followed previous research and observations from feminist scholars and human rights defenders to transfer ethical and responsible practices when working with data related to gender violence and feminicides across geopolitical, digital and linguistic borders. \n\nJasbeth Medrano, the leader overseeing the digitization and translation of the dataset, addresses: “Our second goal was achieved by putting the information on a digital spreadsheet that would make the data accessible to people without a copy of the book. We also wanted to translate the information from Spanish to English to ensure we could reach a larger audience. Each of these parts required a particular level of care and ethics, especially when translating. For example, there were certain abbreviations in the original dataset that my group assumed for the purpose of transcribing (i.e., my group assumed that “p. Negro” was referring to “pelo negro”, which we translated as “black hair”). We were also careful to not translate geographical locations, such as street names, because translating these points would result in inaccurate information (i.e. choosing to keep “Calle Oro” vs. “Gold Street”). In addition, we chose to place certain information in the same cell to make the spreadsheet easier to read, though this was done with careful consideration and group approval. These were only some of the aspects my team had to navigate through when constructing aspects of the data set, all of which we may have not considered had we not taken this course.” _(From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)_\n\n\n## WHAT DATA IS MISSING? HOW IS UNCERTAINTY HANDLED?\n\nFrom the original spreadsheet, there is missing and non-identified data in the cases due to how the cases were handled by authorities where intersectional data violence was present by those in charge of the cases (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025). Nevertheless, the authors of this spreadsheet made plenty of efforts to include the most accurate and humanized data from each case, especially by bringing to their methodology the testimonios of the mother and other family members. \n\nThrough the process of making this spreadsheet a digital and translated dataset version, the project members realized that most of these cases are not registered nor processed in the digital record, which makes us question what would be the best practices and methods in incorporating them? The cases that are present in the digital record are most current ones where digital activism has been involved through hashtags and posts. The ones that are present from the early 90s are the ones that became internationally known and several news reports still circulate on the web. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThrough the intersection of data science and digital humanities through a transnational and transborder gender perspective, students in this course studied, cogitated, and reflected upon relevant digital, social, historical, cultural readings and works. One of the goals of this course was to aid students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Through the course’s readings and projects, students engaged hands-on in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing within feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping, and data science. The intersection between these lines of work is important and necessary because it prevents the continual “[hard-coding of] sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination into the digital infrastructure of our societies” (D'Ignazio & Klein 2020).\n\nAs Jasbeth Medrano articulated about their Dataset #2 analysis in the forthcoming article, “The Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities,” this course emphasized the importance of ethics, especially within her team’s methodology. She reflects that she valued the emphasis on ethics the course’s humanistic approaches to data from the most. Rather than being solely graded for the end product/project, the course prioritized student reflections throughout the process. Since the course taught students about the importance of leading each step with “careful consideration and intentionality,” Medrano and her team were able to apply many of these skills to their final dataset project. Lastly, Medrano reflects that it is “dire that future researchers investigate topics with humanistic approaches that stress working with communities, rather than working on them to avoid further harming individuals.” \n\nThrough Medrano’s reflections, we are able to trace a rich history. Starting with the authors who compiled and published _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra’s _dataset, we see “careful consideration and intentionality” in ensuring that the victims are portrayed as humanely as possible with an intentional feminist approach. These datasets do not cast blame on the victims or their families, but rather the authorities that let this happen. Through the translation and digitization of this dataset, the work of these original authors can be expounded upon and further developed. Many students spoke about using machine learning to create other forms of analysis, while considering the ethical implications of using these technologies. \n\nWhen weaving together Medrano and her team’s reflections and analyses, it is evident that the course provided a safe learning environment to cultivate their projects’ processes. Through the first five modules, students could freely explore and expand on their preferred digital tools and methodologies, which came into play during this final dataset project. Through these initial modules, students also constantly exercised and applied their understanding of ethics when converging these sensitive topics with their digital processes. As instructors, Fernández and Hernández-Trejo also expanded their own digital humanities pedagogy as well, making this a reciprocal experience for many in this course.\n\n\n## TO DO\n\nThere are many ways that this dataset can be and should be expanded upon. We encourage further inquiry using this translated and digitized dataset for future projects related to transnational feminism, decolonial methodologies, and researching examples of grassroots counterdata. Some of the possible further explorations include using machine learning to find more information on the cases with missing data, which would further center the victims’ lives versus her cause of death. Information could include her achievements, her work, and her everyday life as a woman.\n\nAdditionally, these types of courses are very urgent and necessary in higher education as it prepares students to foster caring, ethical and responsible practices using, analyzing and designing technologies using data of violence issues that the world has been facing throughout centuries. In this course, we noticed that much of the sources were counterdata of gender violence and femincidies still exist in analog formats or in public spaces showing the need to foster solidarity initiatives that can work to digitize, digitally process, preserve and have accessibility protocols towards newspapers, letters, documents, photographs, artifacts, testimonios that hold a very valuable memory. Similarly, it is crucial to keep advocating for multilingual and translingual digital humanities and integrate materials and sources from different parts of the world in order to move out of the comfort zone and expose students to realistic research scenarios where data is multilingual (not just in English) and not easily accessible/legible.  \n# 🚧  Under Construction  🚧 \n\n\n# Explore the

*Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas*. Read *El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra* and your assigned testimonio below. As you read, connect your testimonio (the Una Vida chapters) with the introduction.\n\nAs you read, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- According to the \"Preface\", what is feminicide?\n- What legal and political occurrences contribute to feminicide?\n- Having read the \"Preface\" of *Terrorizing Women*, how does this chapter contextualize each testimonio about the daughter's disappearance?\n\n#### Part #2: Maps and Databases of Counterdata of Feminicides\n\nIn teams analyze the map and spreadsheet that is included at the end of *El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra* (students are provided with a copy of this material) and compare it with the digital map of *Ellas tienen nombre*.\n\nAs you observe this data in analog format and the data in digital format, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- What are the areas where the missing and murdered women are being found?\n- What is the data and metadata of each case in the spreadsheet different from the digital map?\n- How is each case represented in the analog and digital map? What other ways would you propose to consider representing each case to move beyond the number or the dot?\n- What is the difference between having this data in a spreadsheet and in a map? How do you engage with this data? What other visualizations will be important to create with this data?\n- How can the data collected by these women be used for the fight for justice against gender violence and feminicides? What else can be included or should change?\n\n#### Part #3: Converging Knowledge\n\nIn pair with a partner that reads and understands Spanish explore the project of *Ecos del desierto* and reflect on the testimonios and visual materials of each woman included in this timeline.\n\nAs you interacted with the data in this multimodal project, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- How do you understand these cases and stories through testimonio, and visual material visualized and represented in this project different from a spreadsheet and a digital map?\n- Why do you think there is only a short number of cases included in this project?\n- Would it be important to include other cases you analyzed in the spreadsheet? What process would it take to put together other cases and represent them in this project visually?\n\n### ASSIGNMENT #2\n\n![Text mining a Sancho Paz newspaper with red rectangles around parts of text](images/text-mining-image18.png \"Text mining of a newspaper\")\n\n#### Part #1: Text Mining Analog Periodicals\n\n1. Read “Transborder Discourse: The Articulation of Gender in the Borderlands in the Early Twentieth Century” by Clara Lomas.\n2. Visit your institution’s Special Collections or alternate archive and explore some analog newspapers and observe the representation of women.\n\n#### Part #2: Text Mining Periodicals\n\n1. Using the Hispanic American Newspapers 1808-1980-Newsbank-Readex select a newspaper from a border city and find one that mentions women. (Many newspapers do not mention women directly, so it's important to find one that covers this topic!)\n2. Through a text mining exercise, you will use the search feature to do a search of a series of keywords to localize the news/advertisements of these related topics. Examples of keywords: women, mujer, femenino, feminine, esposa, wife, asesinada, murdered, killed, girl, niña, educada, educated, trabajadora, hard working, etc.\n3. Then, analyze the newspaper section's representations of women and pay close attention to the language of how the news/advertisements describe women. For example, how women are represented through descriptive language and cultural roles/responsibilities such as through gender roles, her work, what she is wearing, etc.\n4. Reflect on the type of violence that you find through these texts. Include an analysis of intersectionality (identities such as her race, her work, her age, etc.), situating this news/advertisement in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n5. Take a screenshot of your newspaper article and mark the section you analyzed.\n\n#### Part #3: Reflecting\n\nBriefly describe the following questions:\n\n- What impacted you from the way women are represented in these Bordertown newspapers?\n- Did you find or note a pattern with these representations of past and present violence towards women?\n- Having read the Clara Lomas \"Transborder Discourse\" article for the week, answer the following question: how did periodicals (as a medium) help encourage rethinking women's role in society?\n- Currently, how are women represented in social media (i.e. our newspapers)? In what ways is it similar and/or different?\n- *Add any further observations or analysis you would like to contribute.\n\n### ASSIGNMENT #3\n\n![Who or What is to Blame? Assignment #3 intro](images/who-or-what-is-to-blame-image19.png \"Who or What is to Blame?\")\n\n#### Part #1: Analyzing Feminicide Data Using the Ester Chavez Collection\n\nChoose ONE newspaper clipping from the [Ester Chavez Collection](https://nmarchives.unm.edu/repositories/18/resources/1270) box you were assigned. (You may use one that you explored previously!) After translating it, analyze and reflect on the content of the clipping. Think about how the victim, perpetrator, mother, etc. is represented and how these representations can be interpreted in responsible transborder data. Specifically, think about whether the victim is blamed for their murder and how the case is being described or reported. Write a reflection of 500 words including your additional research about the case as well as your responses to the questions mentioned. In your reflection, ensure to reference the readings and materials discussed.\n\n#### Part #2: Digital Archival Curation\n\nChoose ONE of the collections from the following project: [Archiving Feminicide](https://archivingfeminicidio.omeka.net/collections/browse). Note that each collection has a different theme. **Analyze** the collection and the items included in each collection. **Reflect on the message your chosen collection provides, considering that the archival curation was to convey the message of the pattern of \"who or what is to blame?\"** and the pattern depicting the genealogy of the mother fighting for justice. Now that you have interacted with the newspaper clipping and other sources from the Esther Chavez Collection in Part 1, **consider** the different data stories that can be told through the digital archival curation of larger collections such as the Ester Chavez Cano Collection. **What kind of data story through a curated collection would you propose?** Write a reflection of 500 words that responds to the prompt, referencing the readings and materials discussed.\n\n# Suggested Reading and Projects\n\n[Ellas tienen nombre](https://www.ellastienennombre.org/)\n\n[Ecos del desierto](https://ecosdeldesierto.org/)\n\n[The Routledge International Handbook on Femicide and Feminicide](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-International-Handbook-on-Femicide-and-Feminicide/Dawson-MobayedVega/p/book/9781032064390)\n\n[Counting Feminicide: Data Feminism in Action](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048873/counting-feminicide/)\n\n[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)\n\n[Bordeando la violence contra las mujeres en la frontera norte de México](https://libreria.colef.mx/detalle.aspx?id=7759)\n\n[Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1432/Terrorizing-WomenFeminicide-in-the-Americas)\n\n[The Force of Witness: Contra Feminicide](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-force-of-witness)\n\n\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}\n\n# Data Essay\n\n## DATASET TITLE: _El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra (1999)_ Feminicides Digital & Bilingual (Spanish & English) Dataset (2024)\n\n\n## THE PEOPLE\n\n**Original dataset (1999):** Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz\n\n**Translation and digital version (2023):** Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, and Samuel Hille\n\n**Course Instructors and Dataset Advisors (2023): **Sylvia Fernández and Paulina Hernández-Trejo\n\n**Course students (2023): **Jessica Corona, Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, Sara Mosher, Jasbeth Medrano, Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, Samuel Hille, Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, Kiri Avelar, Paris Cantu, Nicolas Rodriguez, Madee Puente-Bonilla, Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, Lily Morrill, Jared Pond, Emily Malloy, Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, Ambonnay Rodriguez, Nilou Esmaeili, Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson\n\n### Original Spanish Data Table\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\n\n/*Inputs.table(search, data)*/\n\nInputs.table(search_spanish_silencio_de_la_voz_data, {\n  layout: \"fixed\",\n  rows: 50,\n  sort: \"Year\",\n  reverse: true,\n  format: {\n    /*RecreationVisits: x => d3.format('.2s')(x),*/\n    Year: x => d3.timeFormat(x),\n    RecreationVisits: x => html`<div style='background:${color(x)}'>${d3.format('.2s')(x)}</div>`\n  }\n})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\nformatted_spanish_silencio_de_la_voz_data = spanish_silencio_de_la_voz_data.map(d => {\n  return Object.fromEntries(\n    Object.entries(d).map(([key, value]) => [\n      key,\n      value === null || value === undefined || value === \"\" ?

The course first focused on a localized perspective in this transborder region before shifting to a broader U.S. and global perspective. \n\nFor over thirty years, the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua bordering Texas and New Mexico have experienced and witnessed multiple forms of violence across its rural and urban regions. Communities are besieged with cartels and gender-based violence, and the saturation of international corporations that pay workers less than livable wages for workers in Ciudad Juárez. An overwhelming amount of attention has focused on Ciudad Juárez for cases of feminicide pointing to the early 1990s as a period when families of disappeared and murdered women, activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and national and international human rights regimes clamored over the hundreds of women and girls who disappeared and were never found, or whose remains were located near or within Ciudad Juárez (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Lagarde y de los Ríos, 2010; Driver, 2015; Lozano, 2019). Concentrated attention was given to the feminicides at that time, but over the years, less focus has been given to the galvanizing efforts of local people to demand responses from authorities to resolve these atrocities. (From Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nDespite the increased social awareness, local community activism, formation of local organizations and nonprofits, and foreign academic interventions—there is still no satisfactory response from Mexican authorities regarding Mexican feminicidios. Among the notable and progressive changes that have occurred to bring justice to the murdered women and girls is the legal classification of feminicide, or _feminicidio_, as Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos coined and inserted into Mexican legal framework, which she co-proposed and co-created (Monárrez Fregoso, Rosa-Linda, and Bejarano 2020). The term femicide emerged from Diana Russell and Jill Radford’s _Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing _(1992), which proposed a feminist approach in addressing the disproportionate killing of women by differentiating these murders from general homicides. Although the direct translation of femicide to Spanish is _femicidio_, Lagarde y de los Ríos argued that it was not enough to classify these murders as separate from homicide; thus, she coined _feminicidio_. By naming feminicide, _feminicidio_, Lagarde y de los Ríos expanded on the definition of femicide to “name the ensemble of violations of women’s human rights, which contain the crimes against and the disappearances of women” (2020). The term feminicidio acknowledges that the killing of women is an institutional and systemic violence, meaning that feminicidios occur because of the authorities’ omission, negligence, and/or collusion with the assailants which inhibits women’s access to justice and thereby contributes to impunity.\n\nYet, even with the legal designation of _feminicidios_ as a form of institutional gender violence, there is much work to be done. Many well-meaning (and sometimes, not so well-meaning) works of art, novels, and films have inadvertently contributed to sensationalizing Ciudad Juárez’s feminicides (Driver 2015). Rather than garnering awareness as intended, some of these media formats have fallen into entertainment categories, further dehumanizing these women and girls’ deaths. With this precedent, it is essential to mention that local community members, such as the victims’ mothers, family members, academics, journalists, and many others in the region and in different parts of the world have been actively archiving and collecting data regarding the feminicides.  (From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nPeople in Chihuahua and the greater border region have engaged in transnational movements to stop gender-based violence by implementing diverse data and record-keeping processes to hold state systems accountable. Everyday people played an active role in pursuing justice in response to backlogged and slow-moving justice systems and negligent authorities working within crumbling infrastructures, which caused other forms of violence against feminicide victims’ families when state systems blamed, ignored, or outright rejected families’ demands to solve these crimes. Families, activists, and human rights defenders were confronted by misogynistic and hyper-patriarchal practices by authorities who perpetuated these ideologies, thus, working ineffectively to end feminicides. Some were inept or even fearful of resolving these crimes, subsequently, exhibiting a dereliction of duty by failing to keep accurate data-keeping files (Monárrez Fragoso, 2009; Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010; Driver, 2015; Bejarano, 2023). \n\nFeminist activists, digital activists, activist-scholars, and everyday people world-wide are vigorously working to engage in data-keeping mobilizations to document and protest feminicides and gender-based violence. These data-keeping resistance movements collect data to contest the intersectional violence that authorities create and foment. Feminist data projects galvanize record-keeping efforts to maintain and even recover data and make visible the extent of gender-based violence in communities across the Global South and Global North. There are several prominent feminist data projects documenting gender-based violence in existence across the Americas. These projects primarily focus on data that is counting feminicides from specific BIPOC women’s groups or regions, and visualizing these crimes through spreadsheets, repositories, and other forms of digital visualizations such as maps and infographics. Collectively, the data from these projects have served the anti-feminicide movement as tools to counter the erasure or minimization of feminicides that authorities will often claim. Of these nine data projects listed below, we will discuss the first three listed in detail, as they are digital public-facing projects that focus on cases of gender-violence and feminicide in Cd. Juarez. Digital projects like Ellas Tienen Nombre and Ecos del Desierto and archival collections like the Ester Cano Chavez Collection are powerful examples of how civil society organizations, everyday people, and families take the responsibility of collecting this feminist data and doing the work of the authorities. They provide transparency and an unofficial record of data with the use of digital technologies and collaborative practices with professionals in libraries and archival studies, visual studies, geographical information systems, web developers, and other allies. Thus, these types of resources provide a digital record with critical data that impacts the lives of many families and serves as a tool to seek justice. (From Fernandez Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025)\n\nActivism, whether it stems from academic institutions, art forms, or through other representations, need to be done ethically, especially since feminicides are a global systemic occurrence and not only occur in the U.S./Mexico border cities. Through the “Border Women” course projects, students approached digital tools, data, and the course’s sensitive topics with the intention of not replicating the same colonial research practices referenced and studied as a class as well as using a humanities-based approach to gender violence data. Since some forms of feminicide awareness decenter the focus of gender violence away from the women and girls themselves, it is necessary that students not only read about and discuss the ethics of gender violence data, but also apply these methodologies and confront these ethical questions through creating their own digital projects. \n\n\n## COURSE INTRODUCTION\n\nIn Fall 2023 with the support of the “Responsible Computing Challenge” of the Mozilla Foundation, with the Responsible Datasets in Context Project,  the undergraduate course “Border Women Literature and Feminist Cartography” to be revised and be offered to students from Data Science, History, English, Political Science, Spanish and Film and Media Studies from the Honor’s College  and the College of Liberal and Fine Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\n The course was offered as a special topic, interdisciplinary, collaborative and experiment-driven, where students explore and critically analyze a selected group of border women’s literary texts, archival material, oral histories, digital projects with datasets and databases of counterdata (D’Ignazio 2024) that addressed gender-based and related violence and feminicides at the US-Mexico border and other parts of the world. Through a close and distant reading analysis students enhance in the development of multilingual humanities datasets to explore a series of thematical feminist cartographies through transnational, intersectional, antiracist, geographical and historical frameworks. Additionally, students explore various methods and digital tools and software with public datasets to convert these excerpts into a series of informative critical data visualizations.\n\nThroughout the course, relevant social, historical, cultural readings, digital material, visual aids, interviews and workshops with writers, critics, activists, project creators and data specialists were included to help students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Overall, students engage in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing at the intersection of feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping and data science.\n\n\n\n![Poster of Responsable and Ethical Digital Memory Making in the Context of Crossborder Gender Violence & Femenicide](images/poster-image1.jpg \"Poster Image\")\n_Image 1. Poster presented by the course instructors at the Academic Data Science Alliance on October 24-27, 2023 at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Data Science School._\n\n\n## COURSE ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW\n\nThe course was divided into five modules and the final module. In every module the students had the opportunity to engage in different forms of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data from different sources, with various digital tools and through multiple scenarios. \n\n\n\n* **Module #1 _Heridas abiertasà Mapeando nuestras identidades: _**Introduction to main concepts: Intersectionality, border identities, feminist and mapping practices.\n\n    \n\n\n\n![Identity and Intersectionality visualization using Miro](images/miro-visualization-image2.png \"Identity and Intersectionality visualization\")\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n![Anastasia Sasha Krouk Blanco comment on Identity and Intersectionality visualization she made](images/visualization-comment-image3.png \"nastasia Sasha Krouk Blanco comment on visualization\")\n_Image 2.

Every team was tasked with a different form of approaching data, thus deciding on a methodology that will work best under the scenario they faced. Throughout this process they encountered several challenges that exposed them work with missing, uncontextualized, wrong data, data in other languages than English, the digital divide, the pre-digital age, lack of information in the digital cultural record, and the need to do field work or work closely with individuals, community members or organizations involved. Additionally, they had great observations of future work that can be done with these datasets or to make this data more accessible in other platforms to better serve those who are advocating for justice in the public and political level, as well as to expand the research on this data of counting feminicides and human rights movements. \n\n\n\n* **Dataset #1: _[Tracing Feminicides in El Paso, Texas Using the Hispanic-American Newspaper Newsbank-Readex Collection](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/ERRyEGE0CLtCpx2UwXke8hgBA-WigVSJKZz6E7iSB_EvkA?e=5dUC0k)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jessica Corona (Leader), Johanna León, Aislinn Reichle, & Sara Mosher</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/ERRyEGE0CLtCpx2UwXke8hgBA-WigVSJKZz6E7iSB_EvkA?e=5dUC0k)**\n    * **Dataset description: **Since the beginning of society in the United States, stereotypes and representations of women have been created to oppress them. Among the most deeply rooted stereotypes in North American society about Latina women, we find those that have been most widely spread in newspaper sections: sections for the home where the differences between men and women are discussed, the praise of short hair as this represents a form of evolution to women but for society it removes a woman’s femininity etc. Sexist language within culture, customs and linguistic heritage means that we do not use language correctly and when we talk about gender equality, sexist language refers to those expressions that denigrate people because of their sex and regarding a series of attributes or functions within society, causing one gender to be positioned above the other. Therefore, sexist language is understood to be language that discriminates, above all, against women. This dataset organizes the data surrounding feminicide violence, language through culture, and feminism from the Hispanic American Newspapers in El Paso, Texas from 1900-1980. Making a counter database of what is happening in the US is important because creating work like this will allow us to understand and inform that gender violence is not only the death in the mexican side of the border but also the way that women are forced to behave or their roles in patriarchal society across borders. Collecting this data into dataset, allows for this information to become more accessible to a broader audience, and can be influential in the work of other students, scholars, activists, community, etc. Bringing awareness to how long gender violence has been occurring, specifically in El Paso, can show patterns and changes in how both feminicide is discussed, as well as how women are generally portrayed and spoken about in the media. It is important that this data is collected and made known of, to better understand the role that publications and news sources play in perpetuating gender violence through the way that they handle discussing these topics.\n    * **Dataset dissemination:** mapping, timeline, text analysis, digital exhibits, policy making\n* **Dataset #2: _[Digital and Translated Version of \"El Silencio De La Voz Que a Todos Nos Quiebra Feminicidio\" Printed Spreadsheet](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc)_**\n    * **Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jasbeth Medrano (Leader), Judith Ordonez, Carolina Vlaun, Alex Sanchez, & Samuel Hille</span>**\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **As part of our assigned reading material, our class read “El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra” by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz. This book was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with an emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This book wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, our group decided to model our project with humanization at the forefront. At the end of the book, the authors provided a spreadsheet of all the cases they were able to locate. The spreadsheet was very grassroots and needed to fit the book page format. Additionally, it was only accessible through this book, ultimately making it very hard to obtain for any other people looking to advance this cause. Therefore, this group took on transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. We also translated this material from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data. However, apart from accessibility, we wanted to provide the contribution of finding articles and pictures of the mentioned victims to highlight the person rather than the details of the case. Though it was tough to find information on all the women, we found a couple links that have been included in the dataset. \n    * **Dataset dissemination: **visualizations, mapping, and policy-making\n* **Dataset #3: _[Geotestimonios Literary Dataset (Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros and Stories of Survival by Alicia Gaspar de Alba).](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EbmXffhLIvNClcOd_Mzl_PcBE8k0G6dwgQlvheM_FX7xFQ?e=lpoirv)_**\n    * Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Genesis Esquilin (Leader), Layla Smith, </span>Kiri Avelar, & <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Paris Cantu</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EbmXffhLIvNClcOd_Mzl_PcBE8k0G6dwgQlvheM_FX7xFQ?e=lpoirv)**\n    * **Dataset Description:** The project's purpose is to collect data of two stories and structure it in a spreadsheet. The two stories assigned to work on were _Woman Hollering Creek_ (1991) by Sandra Cisneros and _The Mystery of Survival and Other Stories _(1993) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba. These two literary texts contain a collection of short stories, so the group was assigned to work on specific short stories books and find the locations mentioned in them. In the Excel spread sheet there are two data sets; one that shows the locations mentioned in stories from _Woman Hollering Creek_ and one that shows the locations that were mentioned in _The Mystery of Survival_. Since there were four of us, we split into two between the two stories and decided which stories we were going to cover. The purpose for these is to map the journey’s, each one painting different narratives of these individual women’s lives. In addition to collecting and organizing data from _Woman Hollering Creek_ and _The Mystery of Survival_, the overarching purpose of our project extends beyond just the collection and compilation of the locations mentioned in the stories. To make these locations specific, the locations mentioned were checked if they were either real, fiction, or personal to the storyteller. For each entry it was added in the line the \\\nlocation mentioned as well as the page number the line is from in the book, and the longitude and latitude coordinates if the location mentioned is real. Some notes were added on a few locations to make the audience know a bit more about the location or for them to have context on what the location means. Finally, some links were included with an image of what the real-life location looks like. Since most of the locations are either fictional or personal, they don’t have longitude and latitude coordinates tie with them. This was an important discussion within the team since one of the objectives was to create a comprehensive and visually engaging map that captures the journeys of the characters within these narratives. This dataset was the beginning steps as we encountered how to map data when we do not have exact coordinates. For instance, by pinpointing the specific locations referenced in each story, the project aims to provide a physical representation of the characters' experiences, offering insights into the cultural and geographical contexts that shape their lives. This mapping project not only enhances our understanding of the individual stories but also allows for a broader exploration of the interconnected themes and shared elements between _Woman Hollering Creek_ and _The Mystery of Survival_ as both women authors are Latinas from Texas with a border identity reclaimed by both. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer a perspective on the diverse narratives within these two books, emphasizing the importance of women geographies, spaces of violence, and mapping the journey the women narrated in literature go through.\n    * **Dataset dissemination:** mapping, literary analysis, spatial analysis, city planning\n* **Dataset #4: _[Films of Feminicide and/or Gender Violence Around the World](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ed5N9T-imoNNgKv2VBVDfNQBbLQwjHmvYXOR0s9XNZdZeQ?e=5CM5Jz)_**\n    * **Team: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nicolas Rodriguez (Leader), Madee Puente-Bonilla</span>**, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Julian Dehoyos, Jada Thomas, & Lily Morrill</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ed5N9T-imoNNgKv2VBVDfNQBbLQwjHmvYXOR0s9XNZdZeQ?e=5CM5Jz)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **In the beginning of our dataset project, we wanted to focus on showcasing the wide range of films that showcase either the gratuitous violence toward women or show the mentality of how women would be treated in that era, we found more films to showcase in our project than expected. Though we are still predominantly shining our light on women and gender-based violence, we found other marginalized communities that can have their messages shared. Films like _Killers of the Flower Moon_ showcase violence based on the Osage community and other similar native American communities, and Milk which shows an openly gay politician fighting to break out of the glass ceiling. These films, though show \\\ndifferent variations and levels of violence, intersectionality of present, it shows the trials these marginalized communities have faced. While engaged in the data collection and analysis we wanted to highlight these stories as well as leave it strictly to gender-based violence toward women. At the end, the dataset evolved and can be defined into four main takeaways/themes: personification of violence, definitions of violence, representation of genre, and missing stories. The first takeaway was the personification of violence; breaking this down into the on-screen, almost jarring reality of the possible glorification, stylization, and informative analysis of violence on screen. Our team felt that many of the films listed on the dataset could be argued and grouped into any one of the said narratives. This allows the audience to further their own definitions of gender violence in film. This does lead to the next takeaway, definitions. Throughout the construction of the dataset, we noticed a common theme with films depicting gender violence and/or having a main plot point be that of gendered violence. Many of the films listed are defined and categorized as “romances”. Films like _Urban Cowboy_, _I_, _Tonya_, and _Lolita_ are all defined as romances; all these films depict graphic scenes of abuse, both physical and mental. Our question as a group is how does depicting and defining this film impact viewers? Are they glorifying? Are they stylizing? Are they informing? Our third takeaway was the cross-representation of genre. The dataset is broad - it includes films, biopics, documentaries, docuseries, horror, historical dramas, science fiction, and many more. We discovered that genre can be a visual but also narrative aid and representation with overall thematic analysis in relation to a film. Many of the films that we listed focused on and outlined meaningful, non-voyeuristic representational work on the issue of violence against women. All the films, across genres, in most ways, were symbolic of violating the heteronormative values of women and other marginalized groups in media; all following the steppingstones of action, resistance, and retribution. The last takeaway was the missing stories that we, as a group, found that were absent after completing the dataset. Again, it is a broad dataset, but there are still not enough individual, personal stories being represented. Many of our films fall under two categories: white, cis-female representation and wide-releases in English-speaking countries. There is a gap in our data that we must be aware of for the future of the dataset. The stories these films captured span from 1918 to the present, but there are still missing stories, missing people who need to be heard through the media of film.\n    * **Dataset dissemination: **app, visualizations, image analysis, digital repository and digital exhibit\n* **Dataset #5: _[Books and Articles from Mexico and the U.S. Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EeZ2sbQ96GJNhqHVMzF9tZUByPzNOhcozSshn6dqJjLiNA?e=SoagHc)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Jared Pond (Leader), Emily Malloy (Leader), Erin Garza, Joshua Scott, & Ambonnay Rodriguez</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EeZ2sbQ96GJNhqHVMzF9tZUByPzNOhcozSshn6dqJjLiNA?e=SoagHc)**\n    * **Dataset Description:<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>**This dataset project was to call attention to feminicide and gender violence in scholarly literature. We wanted to show that these women are remembered and were failed by their society and protectors. To make people uncomfortable enough to understand the seriousness of this topic, and to show that there are people keeping track and those who care. Our dataset tracks information on pieces of scholarly literature primarily from the U.S. and Mexico that relate to femicide and gender violence. This dataset can be used to compare the types of literature and how it is represented across different publishing houses and countries. And the noticeable absence of information from publishing houses in Mexico. Some of our findings include the trait of Chicano, Hispanic, and Mexican authors publishing in areas other than Mexico, leading to the question of how much, and how hard the government and society itself tries to hide this violence. For example, some of the first books touching on these topics like _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra_ or _Cosecha de Mujeres_ had trouble finding a publisher and had even issues with some editors in charge.  Our limitations included: authors not being on the internet, authors being hidden by other authors' articles by other interpretations, and not being able to fully investigate and read every single piece of literature we listed. We also understand that we did not incorporate as many essays, articles, and books as there are in other databases as well. The next step for this project is to keep expanding on these works in any way possible. Those who work on this dataset may be able to make more connections between the data than we were able to see as their background knowledge is different than ours; or maybe even more resources than we do. We also recognize that we are missing data and possibly have inaccuracies, but it’s clear that femicide has become more apparent globally and is something that nobody should be quiet about. \n* **Dataset #6: _[Murals and Public Monuments Related to Feminicide and Gender Violence](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EX7_WITUvZVPhcbk0c-dsXUBfdtoDdsMeU610vx_W7dnUw?e=MXlHGt)_**\n    * **Team:** <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nilou Esmaeili (Leader), Jairo Samuda, Kai Pheonix, Anastasia Blanco, & Branden Jackson</span>\n    * **[Project Link](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/EX7_WITUvZVPhcbk0c-dsXUBfdtoDdsMeU610vx_W7dnUw?e=MXlHGt)**\n    * **Dataset Description: **For this final dataset project, as a group we scavenged data pertaining to murals and monuments placed throughout Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, other various cities throughout Mexico, and internationally. The purpose of this dataset is to hopefully bring awareness to how frequently gender-based violence occurs especially in hotspots such as areas around the US-Mexican border, throughout Mexican cities, other countries of more conservative nature, more populated countries, etc... The list can go on, but the point is, that gender-based violence happens worldwide every day whether we witness it or not. Most of the data sources were from social media sites such as Instagram and X (Twitter). We encountered that when scrolling through these applications, there are a lot of bots, inappropriate content, threats, and unrelated posts. It was frustrating because social media is a good source to pull current information and data from, but navigating was annoying. Originally, our purpose would’ve been to create a program (code) to help the team members easily navigate and pick out the data needed throughout the loads of data and posts we go through on articles and social media sites. Unfortunately, it requires more advanced coding skills to create this program because it utilizes AI databases and even creating databases for the AI coding working with this data requires field work to process this data. Student comment: “I encounter having to interact with data in a way I have not even begun learning nor brushed up on in any of my classes. For reasons such as that, I scrapped my program completely and just manually mined data for our project. It would’ve been a nice way to make it easier for not only me and my groupmates, but my other classmates to use.” \n    * **Dataset dissemination: **mapping, image analysis, digital and 3D exhibits, virtual reality\n\n## INTRODUCTION TO: “DATASET #2: DIGITAL AND TRANSLATED VERSION OF \"EL SILENCIO DE LA VOZ QUE A TODOS NOS QUIEBRA FEMINICIDIO\" PRINTED SPREADSHEET”\n\n\n## ABOUT THE DATASET FINAL PROJECT\n\nAs part of the assigned reading material, students read _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra: Mujeres y Víctimas de Ciudad Juárez_ by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez). This text was published by Ediciones del Azar A.C. in November of 1999, with 1001 issues distributed and no edited version created after. It was created to bring awareness to the severe under-reporting of femicide, with the emphasis of providing a platform for mothers to tell their daughter’s stories. This text wanted to humanize the cases of these victims due to the lack of emotion spreadsheets tend to convey. With this purpose in mind, the group decided to model their project with humanization at the forefront.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Front page of the book _El silencio que la voz de todas_](images/el-silencio-que-la-voz-de-todas-image14.png \"Front page of the book _El silencio que la voz de todas_\")\n\n\n_Image 8.

Currently, there is a scanned version circulating on the internet, but the spreadsheet is not complete, and the printed book is not on sale anymore and it requires a special process to request the book from libraries that have a copy. Therefore, our group was tasked to:\n\n\n\n1.  Make this dataset digitally accessible by transcribing all cases on the spreadsheet onto an Excel sheet that could be accessible to anyone. \n2. Translate this dataset from Spanish to English to ensure that people could read this data.\n3. Include digitized, digital born or digital sources related to the cases documented in this dataset. \n\nThis latter was intended to contribute current information on the web by finding articles and pictures of the victims mentioned to highlight the person rather than the case's details. Though it was tough to find information on all of the women, the team found a couple links that have been included in the digital dataset. We followed the same categories listed on the original spreadsheet. We also created a different tab for the English version on the same spreadsheet, as we thought it would be the best way to organize the data for side by side comparisons. This was the information translated and included in the digital dataset in Spanish and English, nothing was modified from the original, except some duplicate cases that were altered when formatting the spreadsheet to fit the book format. \n\nDataset Link: [Bilingual Database of El Silencio de la Voz (Copy).xlsx](https://utsacloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sylvia_fernandez_utsa_edu/Ee3DNzkSz9pCtA4PLwtsr4kBvnAHBWdAwTis0iiNpXDkHg?e=NRwgPc) \n\n\n## WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM? WHO COLLECTED IT?\n\n\n### Dataset Translation & Digitization\n\nA group of undergraduate students at the University of Texas at San Antonio digitized and translated the original feminicide dataset provided by _El Silencio de la Voz Que a Todas Nos Quiebra_ as part of Honor’s course, “Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies” (Fall 2023) taught by Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla and Paulina Hernández-Trejo. This group of undergraduate students were Jasbeth Medrano (Political Science), Carolina Vlaun (English), Judith Ordonez (Film and Media), Alex Sanchez (Computer Science), and Samuel Friedrich (Kinesiology).\n\n\n### Original Dataset Authors\n\nThe data came from a dataset that was included at the end of the book, _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra_, by Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz, who worked together to collect the data and created the dataset and map previously shown in Image 9 and 10. The authors of _El Silencio_ compiled this dataset and published it in 1999. Besides the dataset, _El Silencio_ intentionally humanizes some of the women and girls that are in the dataset through testimonios of their mothers and family members. According to its introduction chapter, _El Silencio’s_ larger objective would not just be the contribution of this ample feminicide dataset, but rather an intimate encounter between the testimonies of the victims’ mothers and the data itself. _El Silencio’s_ authors wanted this encounter to show how these _feminicidios_ imply a larger systemic violence against women, one that we are all accountable for creating in the way we control women.\n\nThis text does not feature any of the perpetrators or suspects, aligning with its objective of highlighting the lives, not the deaths, of these women and girls. Thus, _El Silencio_ highlights the lives of Erendira, Sagrario, Olga Alicia, Elizabeth, Adriana, Silvia Elena, and Argelia in detail in between the chapters discussing the creation of the dataset. As the authors reiterate, Ciudad Juárez “should be remembered not only for its feminicides, but also for its women who live a common life, perhaps like our own, one like your mother, your sister or your daughter....the victims should never be considered ‘the problem’ or stigmatized for their deaths; the silence, self-censorship, complicity, and negligence are what should outrage and shame us” (6). \n\n\n## WHY WAS THE DATA COLLECTED? HOW IS THE DATA USED?\n\nOriginally the data was collected under the lack of response from the Mexican authorities, the United States government to take seriously the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua and its surroundings since the early 1900s.  Under this situation, the mothers, family members, activists, human rights defender and others have worked individually and collectively to learn best ways to gather information to fight for justice, policy changes and to work on the different cases that have not been solved. In this case, the original spreadsheet of _El Silencio_ was created by the authors of this book, as they were writers and journalists working for local newspapers (_El Diario _and _El Norte_) in Cd. Juarez where they started to get together to collect the data of missing and murdered cases since 1990 through newspapers reports, government reports and then corroborating with some of the mothers and family members through their testimonios. This spreadsheet was one of the first ones that accounts to the feminicides in Cd. Juarez and its surroundings in the early 90s when these cases started to have national and international attention. This data has been used for legal cases and for further investigation of the cases documented, as well as for other activists and scholars to continue advocating from justice in physical and digital spaces through initiatives that keep track of this counterdata of feminicides (D’Ignazio, 2024). Some examples are: \n\n\n\n1. Accountant and founder of Casa Amiga, Esther Chavez Cano, who collected all the newspapers and documents of cases of feminicides. Part of the collection was donated to [Special Collection in New Mexico State University](https://nmarchives.unm.edu/repositories/18/resources/1270), the rest is in Casa Amiga. \n2. Activist and professor Julia Monarrez, author of _[Trama de una Injusticia: Feminicidio Sexual Sistémico en Ciudad Juárez](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/Trama_de_una_injusticia_feminicidio_sexu/V-eDAgAAQBAJ?hl=es-419&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)_, who has been working on a database with detailed information of cases in the 90s and more recently.\n3. Activist Ivonne Ramirez, creator of [Ellas Tienen Nombre](https://www.ellastienennombre.org/), who worked on a database of feminicides from 1993 to the present and visualized them in a digital map.  \n\nFor the “Border Women and Feminist Cartography” (Fall 2023) course, the printed spreadsheet of _El Silencio_ was chosen to be translated into English and was created into a digital spreadsheet with additional information found in the digital record in order for a larger audience to have access to this data in a digital platform and for non-Spanish speakers.  The selection to make this spreadsheet created in the 90s in a digital and bilingual format is due to the generational divide since the issues of feminicides in the border region have been happening during an era that other digital tools and technologies were used and in the present there is a need to update these materials with current digital platforms and technologies to advance the processing and accessibility of previous data work done outside of academia or government institutions.  \n\n\n## WHAT’S IN THE DATA? \n\nA chronology of the cases of missing and murdered women in Cd. Juarez from 1993 to 1998. In English and Spanish each dataset contains specific details of each case (137 in total) such as:\n\n\n\n* Expediente (Case number)\n* Edad (Age)\n* Nombre (Name)\n* Hallada (Date found)\n* Desapareció (Datails of disappearance)\n* Lugar de Hallazgo (Place found)\n* Características Físicas (Physical characteristics)\n* Datos de su Vida (Facts About the Victim's Life)\n* Causa de Muerte (Cause of death)\n* Caracteristicas de muerte: posición, Estado (Characteristics of Death: position, state)\n* Detalles Vestimenta (Clothing Details)\n* Presunto(s), responsable(s) (Potential Attackers)\n* Caso (case)\n* Datos Incongruentes (Incongruencies)\n* Artículos (Articles)\n* Fotos (Photos)\n* Notas (Notes)\n\n\n## HOW WAS THE DATA COLLECTED?\n\nThe data was collected through research in newspapers reporting the cases, testimonios with the mothers and family members, and through, authorities reports and other legal documents.  By consulting and researching from various sources, Rohry Benitez, Adriana Candia, Patricia Cabrera, Guadalupe de la Mora, Josefina Martínez, Isabel Velázques, and Ramona Ortiz (S Taller de Narrativa de Ciudad Juárez) were putting the data of each case together in order to have a more complete image of each case. \n\nFor this project, the new data included was through web research to include digital news reports about cases published locally and internationally. Similarly, the translation to English was meticulously done in order to choose the words that best represent the meanings in Spanish considering how activists and those involved in the movement have determine certain words and specification to avoid the dehumanization of these women. With this in mind, any image or article on the internet that reinforced the interpretation of these cases as death bodies, pieces of body or disposable bodies was not included. Thus, the proceed of making this dataset in a digital and bilingual format followed previous research and observations from feminist scholars and human rights defenders to transfer ethical and responsible practices when working with data related to gender violence and feminicides across geopolitical, digital and linguistic borders. \n\nJasbeth Medrano, the leader overseeing the digitization and translation of the dataset, addresses: “Our second goal was achieved by putting the information on a digital spreadsheet that would make the data accessible to people without a copy of the book. We also wanted to translate the information from Spanish to English to ensure we could reach a larger audience. Each of these parts required a particular level of care and ethics, especially when translating. For example, there were certain abbreviations in the original dataset that my group assumed for the purpose of transcribing (i.e., my group assumed that “p. Negro” was referring to “pelo negro”, which we translated as “black hair”). We were also careful to not translate geographical locations, such as street names, because translating these points would result in inaccurate information (i.e. choosing to keep “Calle Oro” vs. “Gold Street”). In addition, we chose to place certain information in the same cell to make the spreadsheet easier to read, though this was done with careful consideration and group approval. These were only some of the aspects my team had to navigate through when constructing aspects of the data set, all of which we may have not considered had we not taken this course.” _(From Hernández-Trejo, Esmaeili, and Medrano, forthcoming 2025)_\n\n\n## WHAT DATA IS MISSING? HOW IS UNCERTAINTY HANDLED?\n\nFrom the original spreadsheet, there is missing and non-identified data in the cases due to how the cases were handled by authorities where intersectional data violence was present by those in charge of the cases (Fernández Quintanilla and Bejarano, forthcoming 2025). Nevertheless, the authors of this spreadsheet made plenty of efforts to include the most accurate and humanized data from each case, especially by bringing to their methodology the testimonios of the mother and other family members. \n\nThrough the process of making this spreadsheet a digital and translated dataset version, the project members realized that most of these cases are not registered nor processed in the digital record, which makes us question what would be the best practices and methods in incorporating them? The cases that are present in the digital record are most current ones where digital activism has been involved through hashtags and posts. The ones that are present from the early 90s are the ones that became internationally known and several news reports still circulate on the web. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThrough the intersection of data science and digital humanities through a transnational and transborder gender perspective, students in this course studied, cogitated, and reflected upon relevant digital, social, historical, cultural readings and works. One of the goals of this course was to aid students in their comprehension of the distinct and complex approaches and perspectives of humanities data in relationship with gender violence, transnational border issues and human rights. Through the course’s readings and projects, students engaged hands-on in ethical and responsible ways of thinking and producing within feminist studies, literary analysis, digital mapping, and data science. The intersection between these lines of work is important and necessary because it prevents the continual “[hard-coding of] sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination into the digital infrastructure of our societies” (D'Ignazio & Klein 2020).\n\nAs Jasbeth Medrano articulated about their Dataset #2 analysis in the forthcoming article, “The Border Women Literature & Feminist Cartographies: Experiences and Responsible Approaches to Feminicide Data Through Data Science and Digital Humanities,” this course emphasized the importance of ethics, especially within her team’s methodology. She reflects that she valued the emphasis on ethics the course’s humanistic approaches to data from the most. Rather than being solely graded for the end product/project, the course prioritized student reflections throughout the process. Since the course taught students about the importance of leading each step with “careful consideration and intentionality,” Medrano and her team were able to apply many of these skills to their final dataset project. Lastly, Medrano reflects that it is “dire that future researchers investigate topics with humanistic approaches that stress working with communities, rather than working on them to avoid further harming individuals.” \n\nThrough Medrano’s reflections, we are able to trace a rich history. Starting with the authors who compiled and published _El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra’s _dataset, we see “careful consideration and intentionality” in ensuring that the victims are portrayed as humanely as possible with an intentional feminist approach. These datasets do not cast blame on the victims or their families, but rather the authorities that let this happen. Through the translation and digitization of this dataset, the work of these original authors can be expounded upon and further developed. Many students spoke about using machine learning to create other forms of analysis, while considering the ethical implications of using these technologies. \n\nWhen weaving together Medrano and her team’s reflections and analyses, it is evident that the course provided a safe learning environment to cultivate their projects’ processes. Through the first five modules, students could freely explore and expand on their preferred digital tools and methodologies, which came into play during this final dataset project. Through these initial modules, students also constantly exercised and applied their understanding of ethics when converging these sensitive topics with their digital processes. As instructors, Fernández and Hernández-Trejo also expanded their own digital humanities pedagogy as well, making this a reciprocal experience for many in this course.\n\n\n## TO DO\n\nThere are many ways that this dataset can be and should be expanded upon. We encourage further inquiry using this translated and digitized dataset for future projects related to transnational feminism, decolonial methodologies, and researching examples of grassroots counterdata. Some of the possible further explorations include using machine learning to find more information on the cases with missing data, which would further center the victims’ lives versus her cause of death. Information could include her achievements, her work, and her everyday life as a woman.\n\nAdditionally, these types of courses are very urgent and necessary in higher education as it prepares students to foster caring, ethical and responsible practices using, analyzing and designing technologies using data of violence issues that the world has been facing throughout centuries. In this course, we noticed that much of the sources were counterdata of gender violence and femincidies still exist in analog formats or in public spaces showing the need to foster solidarity initiatives that can work to digitize, digitally process, preserve and have accessibility protocols towards newspapers, letters, documents, photographs, artifacts, testimonios that hold a very valuable memory. Similarly, it is crucial to keep advocating for multilingual and translingual digital humanities and integrate materials and sources from different parts of the world in order to move out of the comfort zone and expose students to realistic research scenarios where data is multilingual (not just in English) and not easily accessible/legible.  \n# 🚧  Under Construction  🚧 \n\n\n# Explore the

*Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas*. Read *El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra* and your assigned testimonio below. As you read, connect your testimonio (the Una Vida chapters) with the introduction.\n\nAs you read, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- According to the \"Preface\", what is feminicide?\n- What legal and political occurrences contribute to feminicide?\n- Having read the \"Preface\" of *Terrorizing Women*, how does this chapter contextualize each testimonio about the daughter's disappearance?\n\n#### Part #2: Maps and Databases of Counterdata of Feminicides\n\nIn teams analyze the map and spreadsheet that is included at the end of *El Silencio Que La Voz De Todas Quiebra* (students are provided with a copy of this material) and compare it with the digital map of *Ellas tienen nombre*.\n\nAs you observe this data in analog format and the data in digital format, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- What are the areas where the missing and murdered women are being found?\n- What is the data and metadata of each case in the spreadsheet different from the digital map?\n- How is each case represented in the analog and digital map? What other ways would you propose to consider representing each case to move beyond the number or the dot?\n- What is the difference between having this data in a spreadsheet and in a map? How do you engage with this data? What other visualizations will be important to create with this data?\n- How can the data collected by these women be used for the fight for justice against gender violence and feminicides? What else can be included or should change?\n\n#### Part #3: Converging Knowledge\n\nIn pair with a partner that reads and understands Spanish explore the project of *Ecos del desierto* and reflect on the testimonios and visual materials of each woman included in this timeline.\n\nAs you interacted with the data in this multimodal project, consider the following questions/prompts for reflection:\n\n- How do you understand these cases and stories through testimonio, and visual material visualized and represented in this project different from a spreadsheet and a digital map?\n- Why do you think there is only a short number of cases included in this project?\n- Would it be important to include other cases you analyzed in the spreadsheet? What process would it take to put together other cases and represent them in this project visually?\n\n### ASSIGNMENT #2\n\n![Text mining a Sancho Paz newspaper with red rectangles around parts of text](images/text-mining-image18.png \"Text mining of a newspaper\")\n\n#### Part #1: Text Mining Analog Periodicals\n\n1. Read “Transborder Discourse: The Articulation of Gender in the Borderlands in the Early Twentieth Century” by Clara Lomas.\n2. Visit your institution’s Special Collections or alternate archive and explore some analog newspapers and observe the representation of women.\n\n#### Part #2: Text Mining Periodicals\n\n1. Using the Hispanic American Newspapers 1808-1980-Newsbank-Readex select a newspaper from a border city and find one that mentions women. (Many newspapers do not mention women directly, so it's important to find one that covers this topic!)\n2. Through a text mining exercise, you will use the search feature to do a search of a series of keywords to localize the news/advertisements of these related topics. Examples of keywords: women, mujer, femenino, feminine, esposa, wife, asesinada, murdered, killed, girl, niña, educada, educated, trabajadora, hard working, etc.\n3. Then, analyze the newspaper section's representations of women and pay close attention to the language of how the news/advertisements describe women. For example, how women are represented through descriptive language and cultural roles/responsibilities such as through gender roles, her work, what she is wearing, etc.\n4. Reflect on the type of violence that you find through these texts. Include an analysis of intersectionality (identities such as her race, her work, her age, etc.), situating this news/advertisement in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n5. Take a screenshot of your newspaper article and mark the section you analyzed.\n\n#### Part #3: Reflecting\n\nBriefly describe the following questions:\n\n- What impacted you from the way women are represented in these Bordertown newspapers?\n- Did you find or note a pattern with these representations of past and present violence towards women?\n- Having read the Clara Lomas \"Transborder Discourse\" article for the week, answer the following question: how did periodicals (as a medium) help encourage rethinking women's role in society?\n- Currently, how are women represented in social media (i.e. our newspapers)? In what ways is it similar and/or different?\n- *Add any further observations or analysis you would like to contribute.\n\n### ASSIGNMENT #3\n\n![Who or What is to Blame? Assignment #3 intro](images/who-or-what-is-to-blame-image19.png \"Who or What is to Blame?\")\n\n#### Part #1: Analyzing Feminicide Data Using the Ester Chavez Collection\n\nChoose ONE newspaper clipping from the [Ester Chavez Collection](https://nmarchives.unm.edu/repositories/18/resources/1270) box you were assigned. (You may use one that you explored previously!) After translating it, analyze and reflect on the content of the clipping. Think about how the victim, perpetrator, mother, etc. is represented and how these representations can be interpreted in responsible transborder data. Specifically, think about whether the victim is blamed for their murder and how the case is being described or reported. Write a reflection of 500 words including your additional research about the case as well as your responses to the questions mentioned. In your reflection, ensure to reference the readings and materials discussed.\n\n#### Part #2: Digital Archival Curation\n\nChoose ONE of the collections from the following project: [Archiving Feminicide](https://archivingfeminicidio.omeka.net/collections/browse). Note that each collection has a different theme. **Analyze** the collection and the items included in each collection. **Reflect on the message your chosen collection provides, considering that the archival curation was to convey the message of the pattern of \"who or what is to blame?\"** and the pattern depicting the genealogy of the mother fighting for justice. Now that you have interacted with the newspaper clipping and other sources from the Esther Chavez Collection in Part 1, **consider** the different data stories that can be told through the digital archival curation of larger collections such as the Ester Chavez Cano Collection. **What kind of data story through a curated collection would you propose?** Write a reflection of 500 words that responds to the prompt, referencing the readings and materials discussed.\n\n# Suggested Reading and Projects\n\n[Ellas tienen nombre](https://www.ellastienennombre.org/)\n\n[Ecos del
