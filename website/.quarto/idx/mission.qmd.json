Also, where are there elements of uncertainty or fuzziness in the data?

But understanding what each data point and feature represents is fundamental to ethically responsible data work, so it is important to gives users a way to access and understand that metadata. Which categories were deemed important to catalog and measure, and which were excluded? If gender is an aspect of metadata, is gender only available under binarized categories? Is race included or discussed – and why?\n\n#### Touch Every Data Point\n\nFor creators and users of datasets, it is important to actually explore and try out datasets to make sure they’re accurate and glitch-free, and that they represent what we think they represent---in other words, it is important to actually open a dataset in Excel, Google Sheets, etc., and examine individual cells. When data is too large for these kinds of applications, it is important to examine individual data points in other ways. This is a basic yet surprisingly radical concept! It is especially important when we use automated processes to create datasets, like web scraping, which are also more likely to distance us from individual data points.\n\n#### Consider When Data Should Remain Off-Limits or Private\n\nThere is a growing movement in data science to think carefully about who can ethically access certain kinds of data. Representations of tribal rituals among indigenous communities are often only meant for members of those communities, so accessing photographs or other sorts of quantitative data about that traditional knowledge should probably be restricted. Projects like [Mukurtu](https://mukurtu.org/) have specifically addressed this issue and developed platforms where communities can choose who they share their data with.\n\nSimilarly, the editors of sites like the [Colored Conventions Project](https://coloredconventions.org/) have argued that data about enslaved people and their descendents has historically “served in the processes and recording of the destruction and devaluation of Black lives and communities.” They maintain that there is an urgent need to affirm “the Black humanity inherent in Black data/curation.” In other words, when data is about real people who may have been marginalized or oppressed, it is important that those people be named and recognized.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Our Goals\nData cannot be analyzed responsibly without deep knowledge of its social and historical context, provenance, and limitations.
