If you use our datasets or resources, we would love to hear from you! We have a brief survey here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTNZ40mu2RxJhQ4cON2z2hbV2msLg-4ejp1_luBZp3hfivrw/viewform

We are also open to other feedback and suggestions, and to potentially collaborating with or assisting you. You can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context) or get in touch via email (melwalsh@uw.edu).
