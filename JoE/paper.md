# Summary

Our project, “Responsible Datasets in Context: Collaboratively Designing for Ethical Humanities Data Education,” seeks to strengthen students’ capacity to work with data responsibly. We provide curated datasets that are carefully documented and paired with long-form essays, which both explore and interrogate each dataset’s construction, history, quirks, flaws, and strengths from different humanistic perspectives. We thus provide useable datasets and models for responsible data curation, documentation, story-telling, and analysis.

Beyond our specific educational goals, we also hope these datasets, essays, and accompanying materials will be useful and informative for the broader public. Our target audience is high school, undergraduate, or early graduate students in both the humanities and the social sciences.

Our current set of datasets include "US National Park Visit Data (1979-2023)", "Top 500 'Greatest' Novels (1021-2015)", African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928)", and "Gender Violence at the Border (1993-1998)."  

# Statement of Need

Data cannot be analyzed responsibly without deep knowledge of its social and historical context, provenance, and limitations. Anyone who works with data—from academic researchers to industry professionals—will know this claim to be true. 

But despite its significance, social and historical knowledge and methodologies are one of the most neglected areas in undergraduate computing education. In classes, it is very common for students to use datasets that they find on websites like Kaggle, datasets that are poorly documented and that students thus don’t fully understand. This is a recipe for irresponsible data work and a bad habit that can become a dangerous habit as the stakes get higher. 

# Our Data Essays

The general structure of our data essays are inspired by Heather Krause’s concept of a data biography.

A data essay will and should differ depending on the data it describes, but most of our data essays try to address the following questions:

What is the historical context of the data?
Where did the data come from? Who collected it?
Why was the data collected?
How was the data collected?
How is the data used?
What’s in the data?
What “counts” as a data point?
What data is missing?
How is uncertainty handled?

# Future Contributions

 // NEED TO DO

 

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$


# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"
