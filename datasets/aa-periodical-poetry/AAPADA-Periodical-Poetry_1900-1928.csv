Neath the Crown and Maple Leaf,A.R. Abbott,Abbott,"A SIGH is breathed from million heart.
From Slavery's chains set free:
A million tongues now sadly cry,
Great teen, we weep for thee'

Our Queen is dead; for her all mourn.
In hamlet, palace, hall.
My Queen is dead!"" a warrior cries,
In a lonely Zulu Kraal.

Though high of race, in power and place.
Thy woman's love, O Queen,
O'er every land. from Britain's Isle
To Afric's sand was seen.

The lowliest found in thy domain
Justice to Truth allied;
Tyrants who boast that "" might is right.""
Soon pass beyond thy tide.

Thy virtue set a nobler goal,
Which all might seek to find;
Man calls his fellowman his friend,
Nor asks his hue or kind.

Ye heard, sad victims of man greed.
Her Sovereign voice, which said
""On Britain's sacred soul the slay
In chains shall never tread""

""Soon as the bondman's weary feet
Shall press its holy crust.
That moment he a free man stand-
This shackles fall to dust

On snow-clad [illegible] the North Star smiles
Our guide in days of grief.
But sorrow fled, and joy was found
Neath the Crown and Maple leaf

And now in solemn silence be
Bengali, Bedouin;
In palm-clad isles; 'neath Orient skies
Proud Turk and Fellaheen.

While Afric's sons, wherever found,
In free and blest manhood,
Revere the name of England's Queen:
Victoria the Good.

Can soothe my aching heart;
Can wipe the tears of grief away

April Is On The Way,Alice Dunbar Nelson,Dunbar-Nelson," April is on the way! 
 
I saw the scarlet flash of a blackbird’s wing 
As he sang in the cold, brown February trees; 
And children said that they caught a glimpse of the sky on a bird’s wing from the far South. 
 
 (Dear God, was that a stark figure outstretched in 
 the bare branches  Etched brown against the amethyst sky?) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 The ice crashed in the brown mud-pool under my 
 tread, 
 
 The warning earth clutched my hluody feet with 
 great fecund fingers. 
 
 I saw a boy rolling a hoop up the road, 
 
 His little bare hands were red with cold, 
 
 But his brown hair blew backward in the southwest 
 wind. 
 
 (Dear God! He screamed when he saw my awful 
 woe-spent eyes.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 I met a woman in the lane; 
 
 Her burden was heavy as it is always, but today 
 her step was light, 
 
 And a smile drenched the tired look away from her 
 eyes. 
 
 (Dear God, she had dreams of vengeance for her 
 slain mate, 
 
 Perhaps the west wind has blown the mist of hate 
 from her heart, 
 
 The dead man was cruel to her, you know that, 
 
 God.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 My feet spurn the ground now, instead of dragging 
 on the bitter road. 
 
 I laugh in my throat as I see the grass greening be- 
 side the patches of snow 
 
 (Dear God, those were wild fears. Can there be 
 hate when the southwest wind is blowing?) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 The crisp brown hedges stir with the bustle of bird 
 Wings. 
 
 There is business of building, and songs from brown 
 thrush throats 
 
 As the bird-carpenters make homes against Valen- 
 tine Day. 
 
 (Dear God, could they build me a shelter in the 
 hedge from the icy winds that will come 
 with the dark?) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 I sped through the town this morning. The florist 
 shops have put yellow flowers in the win- 
 dows, 
 
 Daffodils and tulips and primroses, pale yellow 
 flowers 
 
 Like the tips of her fingers when she waved me that 
 frightened farewell. 
 
 And the women in the market have stuck pussy wil- 
 lows in long necked bottles on their stands. 
 
 (Willow trees are kind, Dear God. They will not 
 bear a body on their limbs.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 The soul within me cried that all the husk of in- 
 difference to sorrow was but the crust of ice 
 with which winter disguises life; 
 
 It will melt, and reality will burgeon forth like the 
 crocuses in the glen. 
 
 (Dear God! Those thoughts were from long ago. 
 When we read poetry after the day’s toil. 
 and got religion together at the revival 
 meeting.) 
 
 A pril is on the way! 
 
 The infinite miracle of unfolding life in the brown 
 February fields. 
 
 (Dear God, the hounds are baying!) 
 
 Murder and wasted love, lust and weariness, deceit 
 and vainglory—what are they but the spent 
 breath of the runner? 
 
 (God, you know he laid hairy red hands on the 
 
 golden loveliness of her little daffodil body) 
 Hate may destroy me, but from my brown limbs 
 will bloom the golden buds with which we 
 once spelled love. 
 (Dear God! How their light eyes glow into black 
 pin points of hate!) 
 
 A pril is on the way! 
 
 Wears are made in April, and they sing at Easter 
 time of the Resurrection. 
 
 Therefore I laugh in their faces. 
 
 (Dear God, give her strength to join me before her 
 
 . golden petals are fouled in the slime!)

A Prayer (1928),Alice Dunbar-Nelson,Dunbar-Nelson,"Lord, keep my soul from bitterness and sting,
My heart from searing scorch and crushing blight;
I would not, by my gloom, obscure the light
Which might illumine rocks where others cling.
Far better, Lord, my eager hands should bring
Some little gift with my heart's blood a-dight,
To this great good. Ere I shall merge in night,
Let me not grovel, Lord, aloft, I'd sing.
For those who stand with twisted fear-clenched hands,
And heart's red chalice brimming full of hate,
See life's gold gates swing open far too late,
And peace go streaming by with hurried stare.
Far better 'twere to face the hoarse-voiced crowd,
And hoist love's guidon in the turgid air.",May,1928,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,Sonnet,female,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Dunbar_Nelson
Sonnet,Alice Dunbar-Nelson,Dunbar-Nelson,"I had not thought of violets of late,
The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet
In wistful April days, when lovers mate
And wander through the fields in rapturous sweet,
The thought of violets meant florists’ shops,
And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine;
And garish lights, and mincing little fops,
And cabarets and songs, and deadenign wine.
So far from the sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,
I had forgot wide fields, and clear brown streams; 
The perfect loveliness that God has made,--
Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams.

The Second Generation,Allison Davis,Davis,"Physician
The patients who loved you,
And the hope work brought,
Sustained you, 
When, worn out by late vigils
With the sick, poor and black,
You had to crawl
On hands and knees
To those who trusted you,
Alone.

Physician

You find real pleasure in your work—
Taking liberties when you examine women,
And joking about it later.

You prosper
By prescribing dope to the slum Negroes
For medicine,
And taking their money with no serious effort to help them.

When you have made your “pile”,
You will move as far away from the Negro section
As you can go.

Minister

You have something in you
Which has made you feel the Church
A bigger thing than yourself,—
A Baptist church,—
And which has made you go months without salary,
So that the Church might be saved;

Something
Which has made your talk
Like a friend’s silent confidence,
And your face unlike other men’s,
And made even your wife
Respect you.

Do you wish to call it “God”?
I know you will speak it quietly.

Minister

You make your living
By talking through a service 
About God,
And rejoice equally
To get a marriage or 
A funeral.

Have you convinced yourself yet
That this whole business of a church 
And confident speaking to God, with you leading, 
Is not a madman’s game?

And aren’t they fools to be paying you a salary 
To speak to God for them,
When your thoughts are always
Of a pretty wife
And a larger church?

Lawyer

You brought home your northern education
To bleed the poor “n*****s” you scorn,
Threatening frantic blacks with jail,
And pretending to save them from
The Bugaboo of the Law.
From one love-blind mother,
You boast,
You got all she had,
Three hundred dollars,
To keep her son out of jail.

Well,
Your new car
Is all you have,
And in that your white-skinned wife
Loves her college boy;

While the stupid, black mother
You broke,
Scrubs floors to keep
Her son.

College Girl

You spent every week-end
In all-night liquor parties with your “man”;
You spent the money your mother
Feared to borrow on her home,
Not on books, but on dresses
To make you the belle of fraternity dances.

And you didn’t learn a damned thing
Except the unnecessary tricks of loving,
And ten animalistic dances.

You will teach the Negro students farther south
What you learned.


Northern - College Girl

The chief thing
You learned from your northern training
Was how to be a sycophant with men,
And excuse your parasitism
By calling it love.

Now you teach high school in the week,
And wisely go to your “man” out of town
For the week-ends.

I pity you.
I know how often you’ve wished
You were dead,
When you faced
Your mother,
After those week-ends.

College Athlete

You spend your winters
Juggling basket-balls
And women.
You won’t work,
You won't study,
You won’t marry;

But you have four “letters”,
And a fraternity pin.

College education
Of a hundred like you every year
Will bring the race along rapidly.

Gospel For Those Who Must,Allison Davis,Davis,"The Leader
One lone bird,
Small and brown,
Singing in the morning
One clear note,

Singing to the high church-steeple
With its needle spire
Pointing to the infinite heaven,
Merging with the far blue sky,

In the fresh vigor of the morning
His one clear call,
Harsh, unvarying, but
Beautiful.

Oh, all sweeter, fuller singers,
All loud and busy noises of the mid-day
Drown his voice;

But in the quiet cool of dusk,
By the spire pointing to the far blue vault,
I hear him singing still,

Lonely
With his one unfaltering call,
Beautiful
With his one clear note
Following the spire.

Fighters
These of the coal-black faces
Confide low-voiced,—
Fisherman, washerwoman,
Quietly shutting themselves off
From the pool-room loafers.

Unbroken
By the salt spume of the sea,
Tight-lipped against the whispering fears of age,
He holds her laughing,

In his keen eyes the gleam of one who knows
He must endure all shifting winds, and hate
Of deep-embittered sons of slaving race, Must outreach
The hunger of insatiate women,
And broken nets at sea.

Softens with a smile,
And light of youth’s long hopes and passion,
Sunk away;—

But she has seasoned in her proper time
And grown to mellow laughter,
Strong
Like some far runner turning with new vigor
Home.

Now she is firm against
The tearings of untimely births,
And sweating steam of clothes;
Firm now, at last, against
The pleading smiles
Of brutal melancholy,
Rich-voiced men.

To All Negroes Everywhere
I know lone dwellers on a barren farm,
Who daily drink from acrid waters, rank
With yellow scum and sickening taste,—
Minerals from the dark, deep-hidden earth.

This bitterness they change for health and power,
And stomachs sweetened to their vulgar food,
And now no longer wish
A long draught from the cold, sweet well.

To Those Dead and Gone,Allison Davis,Davis,"Lie broken in the dark, cool loam
You still enrich, not with your force now,
But with your peace. You are a home
Where I return for wisdom, how

To know my own dark roots and this
Day’s newer race, a mute, mysterious
Past, whose shrouded sorrow is
A sign the fates have set us.

Nor are you as a past we scorn;
No mock was yours to us unknown.
We who to daily shame are born
Learn from you in whom our seed is sown.

But tragedy is more than token;
Here life and beauty lie frustrate,
As lie unnumbered broken
Races in the soil of every state.

The Negro's Worth,Alonzo Milton Skrine,Skrine,"Who casts a slur on Negro worth, a stain on Negro fame?
Who dreads to own his Negro blood, or hear his Negro name?
Who scorns the warmth of Negro hearts [illegible] the clasp of Negro hands?
If he but shows his traitor's face, we [illegible] him where he stands.

The Negro's blood! Its crimson tide has watered hill and plain
Wherever there were wrongs to crush, or freemen's rights to gain.
No dastard thought, no cowardly fear his had it tamely by
When there were noble deeds to do [illegible] to die. 

The Negro's heart! The Negro's heart! God keeping pure and free
The fullness of its kindly thought its wealth of honest glee;
Its generous strength; its ardent faith; its uncomplaining trust;
Though every worshipped idol break and crumble into dust.

The Negro's hands! Ah, lift them up. made strong by honest toil.
The champion of the Civil War and of the Cuban soil:
Their battle swords they flash aloft, though death in front they see ;
The Negro's hands did valiant deeds tot brave Cuba free.

They bore the old flag bravely, and were there at Lincoln's call.
They stood beside the foremost rank, with the bravest of them all.
And when before the enemy's guns they held the Gray at bay —
O never could the Afric heart beat prouder than that day.

So if some proud Caucasian cavils at the darkness of your race,
Or speaks in scorn of Africa before her children's face,
Then lay aside the flag of truce, and denounce him where he stands 
For Negro's worth and Negro's fame were won by Negro's hands.

The Brave Son,Alston Burleigh,Burleigh,"A little boy, lost in his childish play,
Mid the deep'ning shades of the fading day,
Fancied the warrior he would be;
He scattered his foes with his wooden sword
And put to fight a mighty horde--
Ere he crept to his daddy's knee.
A soldier crawled o'er the death-stren plain,
And he uttered the name of his love, in vain,
As he stumbled over the crest;
He fought with the fierceness of dark despair
And drove the cowering for to his lair--
Ere he crept to his Father's breast.

The Pool,Amedee Brun,Brun,"Translated by Jessie Fauset 
The lonely pool sleeps in the depth of the glade
At the foot of a slope which its beauty discloses;
And the whispering reeds make a rustling retreat
Which the stream lips or leaves as it wakes or reposes. 

The heather erects a dense rampart of green
To conceal the sweet tide which reflects in its deeps
The tops of tall trees, and this one labor done, 

Forgetting aught else, dreams and placidly sleeps. 
Now and then comes a bird—a blackcap or a swallow,
Which with its swift flight makes the mute, formless hollow
Of solitude ring with a shrill, plaintive sound. 

Its wings barely skim the pool drowsy with slumber,
Yet small, eager waves circling wide, without number,
Haste to die 'mid the pitying reeds grouped around.

To Keep The Memory of Charlotte Forten Grimke,Angelina W. Grimke,Grimke,"Still are there wonders of the dark and day:
   The muted shrilling of shy things at night,

      Lies softly on the leaves at noon.
         These are, and these will be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

Each dawn, while yet the east is veiléd grey,

   I know is singing where the grasses swing;
      Some robin calls and calls at dark.
         These are, and these will be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

The wild flowers that she loved down green ways stray;
   Her roses lift their wistful buds at dawn,
      But not for eyes that loved them best;
   Only her little pansies are all gone,
      Some lying softly on her breast.
         And flowers will bud and be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

Where has she gone? And who is there to say?
   But this we know: her gentle spirit moves
      And is where beauty never wanes,
   Perchance by other streams, mid other groves;
      And to us there, ah! she remains
         A lovely memory
             Until eternity;
She came, she loved, and then she went away.

To Clarissa Scott Delany,Angeline W. Grimke,Grimke,"1
She has not found herself a hard pillow
   And a long hard bed,
A chilling cypress, a wan willow
   For her gay young head... 
   These are for the dead.
                           
2
Does the violet-lidded twilight die
   And the piercing dawn
And the white clear moon and the night- blue sky. . .
   When they are gone?
3
Does the shimmering note
In the shy, shy throat
Of the swaying bird?
4
O, does children's laughter
Live not after
It is heard?
5
Does the dear, dear shine upon dear, dear things,
In the eyes, on the hair,
On waters, on wings .
Live no more anywhere?
6
Does the tang of the sea, the breath of frail flowers,
   Of fern crushed, of clover,
Of grasses at dark, of the earth after showers
   Not linger, not hover?
7
Does the beryl in tarns, the soft orchid in haze,
The primrose through tree-tops, the unclouded jade
Of the north sky, all earth's flamings and russets and grays
   Simply smudge out and fade?
8
And all loveliness, all sweetness, all grace,
All the gay questing, all wonder, all dreaming,
They that cup beauty that veiled opaled vase,
Are they only the soul of a seeming?
9
O, hasn't she found just a little, thin door
And passed through and closed it between?
O, aren't those her light feet upon that light floor,
... That her laughter? . . . O, doesn't she lean
As we do to listen? . . . O, doesn't it mean
   She is only unseen, unseen?",December,1927,Ebony and Topaz,Charles S. Johnson,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Weld_Grimk%C3%A9

God is Saxon, stern and cold. 
For snow is white and ice is cold.
The downy clouds are white. And a 
White moon peeks; when lovers pledge their truth.
Cotton is white and snowy lambkin's fleece.

God is African--for night is robed in black.
The twinkling stars are black men's eyes. 
The black clouds, tempests tell.
While little seeds of flowers birthed are
Tans and brown and black. . . .

Finding earth-plains fair plains, save greenly grassed,
They strewed white feathers of cowardice, as they passed;
                 The golden stars with lances fine
                 The hills all red and darkened pine,
They blanched with their wand of power;
And turned the blood in a ruby rose
To a poor white poppy-flower.

They pyred a race of black, black men, 
And burned them to ashes white; then
Laughing, a young one claimed a skull.
For the skull of a black is white, not dull, 
                 But a glistening awful thing;
                 Made it seems, for this ghoul to swing
In the face of God with all his might,
And swear by the hell that siréd him:

Once more, listening to the wind and rain, 
Once more, you and I, and above the hurting sound 
Of these comes back the throbbing of remembered rain, 
Treasured rain falling on dark ground. 
Once more, huddling birds upon the leaves 
And summer trembling on a withered vine. 
And once more, returning out of pain, 
The friendly ghost that was your love and mine. 
 
 II 
 
The throb of rain is the throb of muffled drums; 
Darkness brings the jungle to our room. 
Darkness hangs our room with pendulums 
Of vine and in the gathering gloom 
Our walls recede into a denseness of 
Surrounding trees. This is a night of love 
Retained from those lost nights our fathers slept 
In huts; this is a night that cannot die. 
Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept 
And tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky. 
 
III 

The downpour ceases. 
Let us go back, you and I, and dance 
Once more upon the glimmering leaves 
And as the throbbing of drums increases 
Shake the grass and the drippimg boughs of trees. 
A ary wind stirs the palm; the old tree grieves. 
Lime has charged the years and they have returned. 
Then let us dance by metal waters burned 
With gold of moon, let us dance 
With naked feet beneath the young spice trees. 
What was that light, that radiance 
On your face?—something I saw when first 
You passed beneath the jungle tapestries? 
A moment we pause to quench our thirst 
Kneeling at the water’s edge, the gleam 
Upon your face is plain; you have wanted this, 
Oh let us go back and search the tangled dream 
And as the muffled-drum-beats throb and miss 
Remember again how. early darkness comes 
 To dreams and silence to the drums. 
 
IV 
 
Let us go back into the dusk again, 
Slow and sad-like following the track 
Of blown leaves and cool white rain 
Into the old grey dreams; let us go back. 
Our walls close about us, we lie and listen 
To the noise of the street, the storm and the driven birds. 
A question shapes your lips, your eyes glisten 
 Retaining tears, but there are no more words. ",July,1927,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",,male,"Africa, Dance, Prize-winning","Ebony and Topaz, Caroling Dusk",New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arna_Bontemps
Golgotha Is a Mountain,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"Golgotha is a mountain, a purple mound
Almost out of sight.
One night they hanged two thieves there,
And another man.
Some women wept heavily that night;
Their tears are flowing still. They have made a river;
Once it covered me.
Then the people went away and left Golgotha
Deserted.
Oh, I've seen many mountains:
Pale purple mountains melting in the evening mists and blurring on the borders of the sky.
I climbed old Shasta and chilled my hands in its summer snows.
I rested in the shadow of Popocatepetl and it whispered to me of daring prowess.
I looked upon the Pyrenees and felt the zest of warm exotic nights.
I slept at the foot of Fujiyama and dreamed of legend and of death.
And I've seen other mountains rising from the wistful moors like the breasts of a slender maiden.
Who knows the mystery of mountains!
Some of them are awful, others are just lonely.
...
Italy has its Rome and California has San Francisco,
All covered with mountains.
Some think these mountains grew
Like ant hills
Or sand dunes.
That might be so —
I wonder what started them all!
Babylon is a mountain
And so is Nineveh,
With grass growing on them;
Palaces and hanging gardens started them.
I wonder what is under the hills
In Mexico
And Japan!
There are mountains in Africa too.
Treasure is buried there:
Gold and precious stones
And moulded glory.
Lush grass is growing there
Sinking before the wind.
Black men are bowing.
Naked in that grass
Digging with their fingers.
I am one of them:
Those mountains should be ours.
It would be great
To touch the pieces of glory with our hands.
These mute unhappy hills,
Bowed down with broken backs,
Speak often one to another:
"" A day is as a year, "" they cry,
"" And a thousand years as one day. ""
We watched the caravan
That bore our queen to the courts of Solomon;
And when the first slave traders came
We bowed our heads.
""Oh, Brothers, it is not long!
Dust shall yet devour the stones
But we shall be here when they are gone. ""
Mountains are rising all around me.
Some are so small they are not seen;
Others are large.
All of them get big in time and people forget
What started them at first.
Oh the world is covered with mountains!
Beneath each one there is something buried:
Some pile of wreckage that started it there.
Mountains are lonely and some are awful.
...
One day I will crumble.
They'll cover my heap with dirt and that will make a mountain.

And ghosts of dead men
Meet their ladies walking
Two by two beneath the shade
And standing on the marble steps.
There is a sound of music
Echoing through the door
And in the field there is
Another sound tinkling in the cotton:
Chains of bondsmen dragging on the ground.

Nocturne of the Wharves (1928),Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"All night they whine upon their ropes and boom
Against the dock with helpless prows :
These little ships that are too worn for sailing
Front the wharf but do not rest at all.
Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think,
No doubt, of China and of bright Bombay.
And they remember islands of the East,
Formosa, and the mountains of Japan
They think of cities, ruined, by the sea
And they are restless, sleeping at the wharf.
Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think
No less of Africa. An east wind blows
And salt spray sweeps the unattended decks.
Shouts of dead men break upon the night.
The captain calls his crew and they respond
The little ships are dreaming—land is near.
But mist comes up to dim the copper cast.
Mist dissembles images of the trees.
The captain and his men alike are lost.
And their shouts go down in the rising sound of waves.

Nocturne at Bethesda,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"This poem won the first prize of $75 in The Crisis prize contest of 1926.

I thought I saw an angel flying low,
I thought I saw the flicker of a wing
Above the mulberry trees; but not again.
Bethesda sleeps. This ancient pool that healed
A host of bearded Jews does not awake.

This pool that once the angels troubled does not move
No angel stirs it now, no Saviour comes
With healing in His hands to raise the sick
And bid the lame man leap upon the ground.

The golden days are gone. Why do we wait
So long upon the marble steps, blood
Falling from our open wounds? and why
Do our black faces search the empty sky?
Is there something we have forgotten? some precious thing
We have lost, wandering in strange lands?

There was a day, I remember now,
I beat my breast and cried, “Wash me God,
Wash me with a wave of wind upon
The barley; O quiet One, draw near, draw near!
Walk upon the hills with lovely feet
And in the waterfall stand and speak.

“Dip white hands in the lily pool and mourn
Upon the harps still hanging in the trees
Near Babylon along the river's edge,
But oh, remember me, I pray, before
The summer goes and rose leaves lose their red.”

The old terror takes my heart, the fear
Of quiet waters and of faint twilights.
There will be better days when I am gone
And healing pools where I cannot be healed.
Fragrant stars will gleam forever and ever
Above the place where I lie desolate.

Yet I hope, still I long to live.
And if there can be returning after death
I shall come back. But it will not be here;
If you want me you must search for me
Beneath the palms of Africa. Or if
I am not there then you may call to me
Across the shining dunes, perhaps I shall
Be following a desert caravan.

I may pass through centuries of death
With quiet eyes, but I'll remember still
A jungle tree with burning scarlet birds.
There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing.
I shall be seeking ornaments of ivory,
I shall be dying for a jungle fruit.
You do not hear, Bethesda.
O still green water in a stagnant pool!
Love abandoned you and me alike.
There was a day you held a rich full moon
Upon your heart and listened to the words
Of men now dead and saw the angels fly.
There is a simple story on your face;
Years have wrinkled you. I know, Bethesda!
You are sad. It is the same with me.

Hope,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"Lone and dismal; hushed and dark,
Upon the waves floats and empty bark.

The stars go out; the raindrops fall,
And through the night comes a ghostly call--

My lone and dismal life's a-float
Upon the seas like an empty boat.

Above the heights where the sea-gulls soar,
The thunder lifts its resonant roar.

Like a jagged arrow a flash is sent,
That splits the clouds with a double rent.

And just beyond my bark that drifts,
Moonbeams steal through the kindly rifts.

And at the quiet water’s edge :
The wind passed over you and you were gone,

After all of death is past,
Wait for me beside the slender tree
And I will see you there and come at last.

On Segregation,Arthur Tunnell,Tunnell,"(Inspired by the Washington protest meeting)

Strong spirits must awaken! for the time,
Unhealthy with a bitter sick unrest
That ne'er relaxes in our fevered breast,
Bids that we, Godlike, rise above the crime
That sullies the still beauty of our time,
That makes a noble state seem still unblest,
Because her weaker brothers find no rest,
But wearied, labor in a cause sublime.
Come forth! ye deep-voices star-souled men,
And o'er the sounding land raise high your song,
Sing o'er and o'er the truth you love again,
To tame the terror of this fearful wrong,
Teach deep inwrought the power of love through all,
That without which earth's glories all must fall.

From every opening vista crowd the mind,
Till all our present duties fade---have fled,

Would we return once more to girlhood's glee
Would we return? I ask. Pray, speak the truth!

Would you recall to earth, from peaceful sleep .

The Christmas Reunion,Augustus M. Hodges,Hodges,"Twas a bright Christmas morning in ""Ole Kentuck"";
Aunt Sallie was busy disrobing a duck-
A featherless turkey close by her side lay,
Prepared for the dinner that bright Christmas day.
'Twas a family reunion, and Uncle Joe Moore
And his good wife Aunt Sallie, both ten and threescore,
Had gathered around them their ""girls"" and their ""boys,""
With these ""children's"" children - the grandparents' joys.
The ""girls"" (all past thirty) were helping to make
The ""sweet tater puddin's,"" the pies, and the cake;
The ""boys"" and the grand-boys the fires were making,
The oldest granddaughter the biscuits was baking,
The little grandchildren a dozen or more
Were tumbling about just outside of the door;
While Uncle Joe Moore, the venerable sire,
Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire.
When the clock tolled the midday the feast was complete,
And after each member had taken his seat,
The venerable sire rose up from his chair,
And with uplifted arms he offered this prayer:
""We thank Thee, our Father in heaven,"" he said,
""For the abundance of good things before us now spread;
We thank Thee, dear Lord, that I and my wife
Have been spared by thy goodness to reach an old life;
We thank Thee, of all things, the sweetest and best,
For our dear children's presence from North, South and West.
Continue Thy blessings, Thy goodness, Thy love,
And prepare us to meet Thee in heaven above.""
The grace being over the feast was begun.
The duck and the turkey were carved one by one;
The big chicken pot-pie received the same fate,
And a generous helping was piled on each plate.
After the meats came the puddings and pies;
Then how the grandchildren all opened their eyes
When one of their uncles from far Illinois
Brought out from the closet a basket of toys.
As dinner was over, the venerable sire
Rose up from his seat and stood by the fire,
Where he called to his side each lamb of his fold,
And blessed and caressed them like Jacob of old.
""What changes we've seen, Sal,"" remarked Uncle Joe,
""These years we've been married, some forty or so.
Now let me see, forty? Yes, forty-one years
Today, since we met at Uncle Bill Steer's.
I remember, ole 'oman, you looked mighty gran',
And I was then, children, er good-lookin' man.
I walked with your mother from Clayton that night,
And 'fore we got home, why I got in a fight.
Tom Scott, a 'patroller,' insulted your mother,
So I knocked him down, and Ed, his big brother.
I then asked your mother if she'd be my wife.
Her answer was: 'Yes, Joe, since you risked your life
For me up the road, and licked old Tom Scott,
Yes, I'll be your wife; why, Joseph, why not?'
But the next day, my children, my master sold me
To an ole Nigger trader' from East Tennessee,
Where I worked on a farm without seeing your mother
For eighty long days, till me and another.
Plantation hand run away and met with good luck,
For we soon found ourselves on the soil of Kentuck.
'Fore my ole master knowed I run erway
We two was married that same Christmas day.
We was married at Scottsville by ole Peter Brown,
Who was a white minister that lived in the town,
And would marry us slave folks no matter or not
If our masters was willing, if we only had got
A couple of chickens or a barrel of corn.
The very next Christmas our Lucy was born,
And the next of the past that I now can remember
Is when we moved here the following September.
Then came the war, Sal, and ole marster died,
While Missus and you, Sal, stood by his side.
Then I left you and children, and went out to fight
For the Union and Freedom one warm summer's night.
Then good Abr'am Lincoln, he sot us all free,
And we had in the county a big jubilee.
Then you boys and you girls all worked hand to hand
To buy me and your mother this house and this land.
Then some of you married, and some went out West,
While me and your mother, along with the rest,
Stayed on the old homestead and worked night and day,
A farming and trucking, and made the work pay.
We are glad for to meet you all back here once more,
And see your dear babies together, before

Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire.
Me and your mother (we are both old and gray)
Receive old Death's summons to call us away.
God bless you, my children, through life, is my prayer,""
And the venerable sire sat down in his chair.
The rest of the evening was passed in a measure
Receiving old friends or by chatting in pleasure
Till long after midnight, with hearts light and gay.

To let them see and know our hearts,
And win a higher place!

And suffered all in vain?
Are we to have our equal rights?
Are we to make the gain?

The wrongs done to our race.

"Lo, the Dusk-Born Daughter!",B. Harrison Peyton,Peyton,"I. 
Lo, my Heart, behold! a girl of modest brown
Is gliding down the paths of our town!
Clings not round her the aura of the morning-child;
For mark, Heart, she came not while
Aurora smiled In silver effusion on the lucid air;
Her figure is not dawn-pale, nor is her hair
Fine-spun of sun-gold into a Phoebean crown!
O Eyes, she is some quickened bronze,
Which transformed to skin of finest texture,
Unto the sense as exquisitely responds
As any gloss of silk or softness of a plush!
But nay, frail Eyes; trust not the groping, blind conjecture!
Ah! tell my Heart by what mutations
Could bronze be turned half so ravishingly lush,
So ripened into rich refreshing fruit as is this girl?
And furthermore, I ask you, Eyes, e'en tho' it were toothed
Of ivory or milky-clouded pearl,
As preciously cut and delicately smoothed
As are her teeth, what mold of bronze—bronze cumbrous and cold—
Could make upon my soul, oh! such enthralling seizure 
As do these luxuriant beauties which some would dare hold
Were but a darkling blush of shame? 
II.
Ah, no, Heart, 'twas of lowly, peaceful dusk God wrought her,
And of benignities that the lofty spheres brought her;
She is of Vesper, child and anointed daughter!
Look! how all the charms of twilight gather to her frame,
And the shades of tropics haunt her lissome shape!
Ay, too, lambent stars are twinkling, e'en when noon's aflame;
Here her crinkling, night-like tresses the gloaming drape.
Soul, gaze her quiet eyes! From what divine skies
Did they, with placid allure of dusk, escape—
These amber haze-beams that, as if ordained, transfigure, 
And with soft halos flush her every lovely feature?
Bewitched Soul, how they mark her perfect, dusk-born creature! 
III.
Thus veined with angel-gossamers floated down
By the eventide, she is become a blessed vision—
Verily, O Soul! Soul! a miracle of brown!
As closer now she comes, oh! mark each luster
Which ripples in a sheen o'er the swarthness that is swirled
About her from pale finger-nail to eye-lash thick-curled! 
Soul, infinitely happy harmonies are
Thus bodied by her in tender, gleamy dark! 
IV.
Ay, she carries the dim spirit of the vesper-star;
And thence it comes that her sympathies impart
To shadow-purpled nightingales the dreaming of her heart
Which so elatedly he sings to rapt-hark'ning lark!
So breathe, Heart, breathe the fragrances that cluster
Round that sweet, peerless bower of her flesh whence she wafts
The warm, reposeful shade of the holy palm
And such meady dews as flavor lands of southern calm!
And drink, Heart! O Heart! drink of Elysian balm
Which her elixir-like touch brings in redolent drafts
From nightward nectaries that have their place
In lunar regions of supernal space!
And then, my Heart, let your every vibrant fiber sense
The essence, as it were, of oenomel which seems thence
To lave its haze on her delicious face,
Where is set, like a red-brown kiss, the mouth that quaffs
Its flow—oh! blissful flow the nectaries dispense
To but her who, by divine right of race, 
Is twilight vestal, and to eve enchantress-daughter
And purest cast of gloam in fluent grace of water! 
V.
God! shall lewd flames count wanton, wind-raked husk
This girl whose nature heaves such sacred spells of dusk?
Love! O true Love! how chaste with cloistral sundown
And ways that breathe rosy airs of saintly musk, 
Oh! she must be, since that her being wears for gown
Heav'n's own highness in pure glows of auburn brown! 
VI.
Thus she moves zephyr-like in virgin grace of leisure!
And since she is sylphine-imbued with nightfall 'that drowns
Earth in ethereal tides of marvelous browns,
How meet it is that her feet, O Columbian World,
Are given to thread your occidental spread!
Why then, mad World, are persecutive shadows thus hurled
Before her feet? E'en so, World, behold! tho' meek and demure,
Yet she walks in stanch and serene procedure,
Unfaltering in her fortitude and gentle state,
Towards far horizons where, beaconing, there wait
For her more golden triumphs than any sunset has!
Ay, her way leads through dread labyrinths of hate, 
Mid trails of scorn pythonic, and minotaurs of wrath,
But like the dusk, she walks above her earthly path! 
VII.
She is some ministrant dove of celestial orders,
Or dark-veiled, mist-winged sprite, flown from Hesperian borders 
And traced of poised cloud-drift and willowed, phantom waters!

Now let the arrow hiss in air and sing;
Now let the spear-point on the armor ring;
Sound forth the call to wars that never cease!

Ye hoot the yellow Mongol from your land;
But forth to regions all his own ye go
To reap the riches of his overflow,
And just ye call the working of your hand!

Now see the scramble of the Christian host--
Them all press forward for the spoil that's won;
New wars! new wars! ris'n on the olden one--
And this, this the enlightened freeman's boast!

But greater is the strife than here would seem,
And wider realms embracing than the East,

The weary Titan groaned beneath the weight
Of nations growing weaker day by day,
Whose men he deemed but men of minor clay,
And destinies he wrought for them their fate.

And why, methought, does not the giant's creed
Cast off the weaklings that would warp his might,
And leave alone the wretches in their plight?
No answer save ""I would not"" from his greed.

So freedom hails th' advance of king and queen;
The march of mind goes on o'er field and flood;
Republics curb the weak with shows of blood;
And lordly priests profess the Nazarene!

Ephesus ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"A mighty temple raised in the air,
   With piles of jewels, heaps of stone,
Ionic columns large and fair

Bestow on ancient Ephesus.

    Did reign, dull Silence sits and sings;

Scarce lingers now one stone on stone.

Two hundred years in Coelian's breast,

    The arms of Persia and of Rome,
Ten thousand souls to Hades hurled,

Paul Lawrence Dunbar ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"And so thou'rt gone, O brother to the night!
After the years of waiting and the pain,
After the striving and the stress thou'rt gone!
After the pulsing heart-throb and the fret,
The quick reward, the sudden voice of fame,
The noisy clamor of a great world's praise,
The great far-sight into the heart of things,
Thou'rt gone, and wilt be with us here no more.
We loved thee, brother, in this nether light,
With hearts more full of love than we did dream;
We loved thy voice, thy work, they heart, thy hope,
Thy aspiration and enlightened view,
We loved thee in the darkness of the year
When thou didst tread the borderland of death;
And love thee now with that far greater love
That beckons us to thy eternal light.
And when in some far-off hereafter day
The voice of Fame shall speak her last decree,
When she shall summon from the wreck of worlds
The names that Time's great movement shall defeat,
And when then she shall stand beside thy tomb,
The laurel in her hand, and think on thee,
Tis then will be thy word upon the scroll:
He voiced the yearning of a people's soul. ",April,1906,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Elegy,male,"Intertext, Paul Laurence Dunbar",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley
The Dawn ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"There came a dark youth singing in the dawn
Of a new freedom, to a mellow lyre,
Refining, as with touch of an Apollo's fire,
The songs a lowly people sang upon
A toilsome way. The night of gloom was gone;
He stood, full-throated, cheering son and sire
To garner grain, despising rain and mire
Of yesternight. ""To-day,"" he sang, ""toil on
And up, my race, from vale toward glory's crest!""
Men marvelled at the singer, strong and sweet.
He left the forest, drenched with storms of night,
And faced the morning, beautiful with light,
To die while shadows still fell toward the west,
And leave his laurels at a people's feet.",May,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,"Progress and Racial Uplift, Religion",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley
First Sight ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"I did not dream when first I saw you, dear,
That I should ever love you-- didnot dream
that by and by I should unhappy deem
Each day that brough no message to my ear;
You were so young, so wicked, and so near
To all that pained me that it did not seem
That sometime in the after years the gleam
That comes with love would bid me have no fear;
But all those days are over and are gone;
Above them rests the Never-Nevermore;
At midnight in the silence and anon
It is your voice that trembles o'er and o'er--
Your heart that thrills me with its own sweet tone--
Your love that bids me claim you all my own. ",June,1906,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley
To One Untrue ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"Oft I remember all the golden days
And all the many gilded nights full-blown
With murmured music and with whispered lays
Of never-ending faith, each in his own;
Oft have I revelled in the blissufl gaze
With which your heart would answer mine, full grown
With love, until a night (ah, me! our ways!)
When you for love gave laughter and a stone
For bread, comes up before me with its pain;
Then all the raging madness and the fret
And the hot flood of tears comes back again--
Comes back with all its bitterness, and yet--
The beauty and the music still remain,
Beauty and music I can ne'er forget. ",May,1906,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley
Sanctuary,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"I have drunk in the fullest measure 
    The draught of the Demon's flesh-wine,
And over the wrecks of my pleasure
    The lights of the lower world shine;
And now here to-night I am thinking 
     Of all the dark paths I have trod,
And I hate all the sin and the sinking 
    And want to go back to my God.
I am tired of the night and its yearnings, 
    I am tired of the pain in my breast;
I am weary of jealousy's burnings,
    And am longing for quiet and rest;
For the pain in my prison is pressing
Me down, and the Tempter is there---
I want to go back to the blessing
    And breath of a holier air.
O heart, you and I are but lovers ,
    And we love in the human way;
Even now in the darkness there hovers
    Around us the light of they day;
But we know just as sure as that gladness
    Is up in the heaven on high,
That our sinning is folly and madness
    And will bring its despair by and by 
So to-night while our warm hearts are beating
    And our blood surges up hot and bold,
While we once again are repeating 
    The story ten thousand years old,
May our hearts be uplifted, united,
    May the flesh see the fate it deserves,
May our love in its richness be lighted 
    By the best in ourselves that it serves.
I am weary of envy and sinning,
    I am weary of fever and strife, 
I turn myself now to the winning
    Of the best and the noblest in life;
What is better than love at its purest?
    What is worse than the love of the sod?
And the love that is firmest and surest 
    Is the love that is nearest God. ",,1907,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,,,Chicago,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley
I Met A Little Blue-Eyed Girl,Bertha Johnston,Johnston,"A certain element in the South takes pains to rear the children of the family faithfully in the doctrines of Blease and Vardaman. 'A Negro had been lynched in the neighborhood,' said a recently returned traveler, 'and crowds went out to see what was left of his body. The people I was staying with went with the rest and took their children--all but one, who had been naughty and was kept home as a punishment.'

I met a little blue-eyed girl--
She said she was five years old;
'Your locket is very pretty dear;
And pray what may it hold?'
And then--my heart grew chill and sick--
The gay child did not flinch--
'I found it--the tooth of a colored man--
My father helped to lynch.'
'And what had he done, my fair-haired child?'
(Life and Death play a fearful game!)
'Oh, he did nothing--they made a mistake--
But they had their fun, just the same!'

For Ethiopia,Bessie Brent Madison,Madison,"Dark-skinned Mothers of America,
Who sit today, perhaps, with bowed down head,
Because your home is lonely since he left--
Leave all to God, and rise and smile instead;
Stretch forthh tthe arms that nursed him as a child
And guided his dear feet in ways of truth,
Remembering how your love has glorified 
And brightened all his earnest, hopeful youth.
Stretch forth your ams to Heaven, and say to Him:
'God, I have given my best, my all, to fight
In Freedom's holy name-- to live or die.
Which seemeth best, for justice and for right!
Grant thou, O God, that through this sacrifice,
When blood has well atoned for ancient wrong,
That Ethiopia's Sons may raise their heads
And sing a louder, clearer, grander song.'

Let it be so, when this dread war shall cease,
When hushed is every bitter cry of woe,
That all your children who to earth are spared,
In bonds of fellowship may firmer grow.
For none were better, stronger, nor more brave,
Than those of ours who sleep with ice-cold brow.
Let other nations rise and plead our cause.
And let them understand, who scorn us now!

Down at the Feet of the Years,Bessie Brent Madison,Madison,"Down at the feet of the years we shall find them
All of the dear vanished things,
All of the dreamings that never came true,
All that 'might have been' for me and for you.

Find our dead flowers fragrant with dew,
Growing by life-giving springs.

Down at the feet of the years we shall find them
Tenderly hidden away,
Wee little laddies that never were men,
Wee little lassies that never knew sin.

Down at the feet of the years we shall find them
Jewels that once were our tears.
Find all our losses were infinite gain,

Mysteries too deep for our dull, human ken,
Kept for a happier day.

Find perfect joy that we once thought was pain.
Praise in abundance that once seemed as blame,
Down at the feet of the years.

It is a timid little fawn
Creeping softly up to me
For one caress, then gone

It is the break of day that wears
A shining dew decked diadem… 
An aftermath of tears.
Fawn and dawn, emblems of joy… 
I've played with them for years,
And always they will slip away
Into the brush of another day.
Is a human heart more brazen
Than a floating, fleecy cloud
Pillowed on the sky's blue bosom,
Kissing stars before the crowd
Of earthly prudes, all forgiving
Secret passions of the earth
Seducing a virgin seed
Till a bastard tree makes birth?
Is a human heart immodest
More so than a cold steel pin
Staggering to a magnet, waiting,
Or a hen bird fluttering when
Her mate calls? Can it be sin?

A Dark Actress -- Somewhere,Blanche Taylor Dickinson,Dickinson,"They watched her glide across the stage,
Each one poised with breath a tip- toe,
Felt his soul strings link with hers,
Loosed his heart and let it go
To her brown and tapering fingers,
Crushing it into a ball,
Throwing it with accuracy,
Smiling as she saw it fall.
Bending willow-like to music,
As a bird in willows, singing
Of a love that's so much fancy
From a dream marsh ever springing.
""Art,"" the critic said next day,
And people flocked to see her play.
Laid their fair hearts at her feet–
But never saw her on the street.

That Hill,Blanche Taylor Dickinson,Dickinson,"That Hill
This poem won honorable mention in THE CRISIS contest of 1926.

IT crawled away from ’neath my feet,
And left me standing there;
A little at a time, went up
An atmospheric stair.

I couldn’t go for watching it,
To see where it would stop;
A tree sprang out and waved to me
When it had reached the top.

The tree kept nodding friendly like,
Beckoning me to follow;
And I went crawling up and up,
Like it did from the hollow.

Then I saw why the thing would go
A-soaring from the dell—
T’was nearing Heaven every bound,
And fleeing fast from Hell!

To One Who Thinks of Suicide,Blanche Taylor Dickinson,Dickinson,"Sometimes it seems that only cowards live
With weighted hearts each day;
It seems braver far to take life up and go
A solitary way.
It seems a self reliant soul should know
When life has palled,
And win applause for surprising God . . .
Going in . . . uncalled.

Poor vain, gallant hero,
If the journey ended at the grave
I would cheer you . . . or perhaps I'd go
And wear the laurels of the brave.

But no! I rather choose to stay
And trust the clouds to blow away.

Until God blows my candle out . . .

But with a will like Nero, his cruel chains did break.

If in the unknown regions, all are rewarded the same,
If to the hero modern, honor is rightly given,
His is a sapphired crown in the bright kingdom of heaven.

Bringing from under-byways
Into freedom's sunshine and joy.
Tell of the noble plea the companion of martyred John Brown,
Earth but records - heaven rewards
The worthy with worthy renown.
Tell of the noble traits of character true as steel,
Tell of the fear-fraught days which every true patriot feels.
Tell of the powerful mind that forces the just decree,
Fair Ethiope placed with thee her hopes in blessed security.
Wet are the cheeks of millions; loudly do they lament,
Whence thou art swiftly riven from the mundane transient.
Death- unsatiable devourer thou checkmate of good men's
deeds,
-
Visiting earth each hour, unmindful of worldly needs,
But to thy name and prestige, posterity ever lauds,
Honor in life, happy in death, near the throne of the living God.

Will be changed to deeds divine,
   Like those above.
Let wailings swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees:
   ""God's will be done.""
Let mortal souls awake--
Let all that breathe partake--
This spell of crimes to break,
   Ere the nation's gone.
O gracious God, to thee,
In thine all-wise mercy,
   We now appeal!
May this land soon be brought
Out of this doome it's wrought;
For long, in vain, we've sought
   Freedom to feel. ",September,1900,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,"Lynching and Racialized Violence, Patriotism, Racism",,Boston,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/charles-frederick-white-author-page
We Who Are Dark,Clara Burrill Bruce,Bruce,"We who are dark
And know the lash
On bodies worn,
Insensate made
Through years of wrong;
That feel no more
The scourge, the whip--
We who are dark
And know the hurt
Of pitiless scorn
On souls that live
And feel the dart
And thrust of wrong;
The greedy glance
Of sinful lust--
We who are dark
And know the urge
Of blinding rage
And fury red,
that eats and burns;
the ache of hands
Pressed on by hearts
On vengeance bent--
We've won your praise
That side by side
With those who taught
Us all our woes
We bravely march
Nor backward glance,
Not hesitant,
Nor slow, but with
Quickening treat
Old wrongs, old sores
Forgotten lie;
Brothers-in-arms,
As we march forth
To Victory,
Bearing aloft
To foreign lands
A freedom sweet
That's not our own.

The Mask,Clarissa Scott Delaney,Delaney,"So detached and cool she is
No motion e'er betrays
The secret life within her soul,
The anguish of her days.
She seems to look upon the world
With cold ironic eyes,
To spurn emotion's fevered sway,
To scoff at tears and sighs.
But once a woman with a child
Passed by her on the street,
And once she heard from casual lips
A man's name, bitter-sweet.
Such baffled yearning in her eyes,
Such pain upon her face!
I turned aside until the mask
Was slipped once more in place.",October,1926,Palms,Countee Cullen,,female,,Caroling Dusk,"Guadalajara, Mexico",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Scott_Delany
Solace,Clarissa Scott Delany,Delany,"My window opens out into the trees
And in that small space
Of branches and of sky
I see the seasons pass
Behold the tender green
Give way to darker heavier leaves.
The glory of the autumn comes
When steeped in mellow sunlight
The fragile, golden leaves
Against a clear blue sky
Linger in the magic of the afternoon
And then reluctantly break off
And filter down to pave
A street with gold.
Then bare, gray branches
Lift themselves against the
Cold December sky
Sometimes weaving a web
Across the rose and dusk of late sunset
Sometimes against a frail new moon
And one bright star riding
A sky of that dark, living blue
Which comes before the heaviness
Of night descends, or the stars
Have powdered the heavens.
Winds beat against these trees;
The cold, but gentle rain of spring
Touches them lightly
The summer torrents strive
To lash them into a fury
And seek to break them-
But they stand.
My life is fevered
And a restlessness at times
An agony—again a vague
And baffling discontent
Possesses me.
I am thankful for my bit of sky
And trees, and for the shifting
Pageant of the seasons.
Such beauty lays upon the heart
A quiet.
Such eternal change and permanence
Take meaning from all turmoil
And leave serenity
Which knows no pain.",June,1925,Opportunity,Charles S. Johnson,Free Verse,female,Prize-winning,Caroling Dusk,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Scott_Delany
To the White Fiends,Claude McKay,McKay,"Think ye I am not fiend and savage too?
Think ye I could not arm me with a gun
And shoot down ten of you for every one
Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you?
Be not deceived, for every deed ye do
I could match--out-match: am I not Afric's son,
Black of that black where black deeds are done?
But the Almighty from the darkness drew
My soul and said: Even thou shalt be a light
Awhile to burn on the benighted earth,
Thy dusky face I set among the white
For thee to prove thyself of highest worth;

Thou who from out the dark and dust didst raise
The Ethiop standard in the curtained days,
Before the white God said: Let there be light!

Harlem Dancer,Claude McKay,McKay,"Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls
Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise,
The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,
Devoured her shape with eager, passionate gaze;

And passion rends my vitals as I pass,
Where boldly shines your shuttered door of glass.
Oh I must search for wisdom every hour,
Deep in my wrathful bosom sore and raw,
And find in it the superhuman power
To hold me to the letter of your law!

Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay,
And proudly thrives in rain or time of dearth,
When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away;
Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep,
For sunken water, fluid underground,
Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep,
And queer things of the nether world abound:
So would I live in rich imperial growth,
Touching the surface and the depth of things,
Instinctively responsive unto both,
Tasting the sweets of being and the stings,
Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms,
Like a strong tree against a thousand storms.",March,1925,Survey Graphic,Alain Locke,Sonnet,male,,The New Negro,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
In the Hospital,Claude McKay,McKay,"After the nights like days, the days like nights,
Crowded with movement, filled and overflowing,
Whirling like circling birds in aimless flights,
Dipping round gilded dome and steepled heights,
Blessed is being here and without knowing
Or caring of the city’s ways and sights.
With peace dearer than love within my breast,
Blessed is being here behind the curtain,
Blessed to know the meaning of real rest,
Where even thought can at its virile best
Be sweet, yet no less militant and certain
Than a fierce eagle folded in its nest.

Far from the petty troubles of the street,
And little men who mouth their little woe,
Blessed is being in this strange retreat,
Blessed the sleepy hours so long and sweet,
That fold me in from life my friend and foe,
With kindly bands about my hands and feet.

Like music blown through tropical corn sheaves,
Blessed the foreign tongue that soothes and charms,
Like golden drops of rain from thick-thatched eaves,
That fall into uplifted tania leaves,
Blessed disease, the bitter scourge, that warms
My chastened spirit that here new hope receives.

The International Spirit,Claude McKay,McKay,"As flower dust is driven down the wind
To touch and quicken the green life of earth,
As birds spread wings and leave cold lands ‘behind,
For regions of sweet warmth and singing mirth:
So shall thy thought be carried surely forth
To the remotest dwellings of mankind,
Reaching its inmost self to give new birth,
New strength, new purpose to man’s boundless mind.

The birds of time shall wing thee down the ways
Of man’s abode. Thy progress will be keen
Against the heavy mist of stormy days,
As ever progress through the years has been.
Even as strong-winged messengers are seen,
In these amazing times with fine amaze,
Threading the tides of space that roll between
The earth and heavens that ever hold man’s gaze.

The nations will be stricken at thy word,
And grand old prejudices crumble down,
That ancient pride in warring breasts has stirred.
The noblest men shall work for any renown.
Thy truest heralds do not fear the frown
Of legioned bigots leagued by fear and spurred
To crush thy truth, but more the shouting clown,
The standard-flocking of the sheeplike herd.

A Daughter of the American Revolution to Her Son ,Claude McKay,McKay,"I'm happy that you graduated high,
It stirs my pride to see what you could do
In these times, when our ways are all awry
And threatened by the vulgar parvenu.
Our noble name is linked with all the good
New England yielded from her sterling worth,
To make our country great and understood
Among the greater nations of the earth.
Our line is of a sturdy English breed,
That sought an alien land for human rights;
We always have insisted on the need
Of viewing life from our own lofty heights.
Only your great grandfather once went wrong,
Becoming radical in slavery days,
When party strife the country cleaved for long
And petty agitators strove for praise.
Remember to forget your great grand-father,
Sometimes you worry me with traits like his,
Shun sentimental liberals, but rather
Uphold the law and give to charities.",March,1926,The Crisis,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset",,male,Slavery,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
The Void,Claude McKay,McKay,"He crouches strangely in the little bed
And earnestly stares blankly into space,
Reason forever more from him has fled,
A child's mind settles sadly on his face.

The classic loveliness of plain white walls,
The shadows softening the long, low ceiling,
Against the low dull lights at evening fall,
Impart to the sick room a holy feeling.

Maybe no hand once trembled with desire,
Sheer love of form, to touch that ugly brow,
But here disease-transformed, scourged by the fire, 
Beauty the loftiest has touched it now.

New peoples marvel at thy pyramids!
The years roll on, thy sphinx of riddle eyes
Watches the mad world with immobile lids.

Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
   And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
And we will seek the quiet hill
   Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
   And works the droning bee.
And we will build a lonely nest

A Capitalist at Dinner,Claude McKay,McKay,"An ugly figure, heavy, overfed,
Settles uneasily into a chair;
Nervously he mops his pink bald head,
Frowns at the fawning waiter standing near.
The entire service tries its best to please 
This overpampered piece of broken-health,
Who sits there thoughtless, querulous, obese,
Wrapped in his sordid visions of vast wealth.

Negro Dancers,Claude McKay,McKay,"I
Lit with cheap colored lights a basement den,
With rows of chairs and tables on each side,
And, all about, young, dark-skinned women and men
Drinking and smoking, merry, vacant-eyed.
A Negro band, that scarcely seems awake,
Drones out half-heartedly a lazy tune,
While quick and willing boys their orders take
And hurry to and from the near saloon.
Then suddenly a happy, lilting note
Is struck, the walk and hop and trot begin,
Under the smoke upon foul air afloat;
Around the room the laughing puppets spin
To sound of fiddle, drum and clarinet,
Dancing, their world of shadows to forget.
II
’Tis best to sit and gaze; my heart then dances
To the lithe bodies gliding slowly by,
The amorous and inimitable glances
That subtly pass from roguish eye to eye,
The laughter gay like sounding silver ringing,
That fills the whole wide room from floor to ceiling,—
A rush of rapture to my tried soul bringing—
The deathless spirit of a race revealing.
Not one false step, no note that rings not true!
Unconscious even of the higher worth
Of their great art, they serpent-wise glide through
The syncopated waltz. Dead to the earth
And her unkindly ways of toil and strife,
For them the dance is the true joy of life.
III
And yet they are the outcasts of the earth,
A race oppressed and scorned by ruling man;
How can they thus consent to joy and mirth
Who live beneath a world-eternal ban?
No faith is theirs, no shining ray of hope,
Except the martyr’s faith, the hope that death
Some day will free them from their narrow scope
And once more merge them with the infinite breath.
But, oh! they dance with poetry in their eyes
Whose dreamy loveliness no sorrow dims,
And parted lips and eager, gleeful cries,
And perfect rhythm in their nimble limbs.

A Memory of June,Claude McKay,McKay,"When June comes dancing o’er the death of May,
With scarlet roses tinting her green breast,
And mating thrushes ushering in her day,
And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest,

I always see the evening when we met─
The first of June baptized in tender rain─
And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet,
Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love’s pain.

I always see the cheerful little room,
And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed,
Sweet scented with a delicate perfume,
Wherein for one night only we were wed;

Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute,
And heard the whispering showers all night long,
And your brown burning body was a lute
Whereon my passion played his fevered song.

When June comes dancing o’er the death of May,
With scarlet roses staining her fair feet,
My soul takes leave of me to sing all day
A love so fugitive and so complete.

Morning Joy,Claude McKay,McKay,"At night the wide and level stretch of wold,
Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold,
Far as the eye could see was ghostly white;
Dark was the night save for the snow’s weird light.

I drew the shades far down, crept into bed;
Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead
Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain,
Went sorrowing with it across the plain.

At dawn, behold! the pall of night was gone,
Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone,
Detained a fragile shadow. Golden-lipped
The laughing grasses heaven’s sweet wine sipped.

The sun rose smiling o’er the river’s breast,
And my soul, by his happy spirit blest,
Soared like a bird to greet him in the sky,
And drew out of his heart Eternity.",August,1921,The Liberator,"Max Eastman, Claude McKay",Common Measure,male,,Harlem Shadows,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
The Easter Flower,Claude McKay,McKay,"Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly
     My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,
Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily
     Soft-scented in the air for yards around;

Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!
     Just like a fragile bell of silver rime,
It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief
     In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;

And many thought it was a sacred sign,
     And some called it the resurrection flower;
And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,
     Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power.",March,1921,The Liberator,"Max Eastman, Claude McKay",Common Measure,male,,Harlem Shadows,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
Baptism,Claude McKay,McKay,"Into the furnace let me go alone;
Stay you without in terror of the heat.
I will go naked in–for thus ’tis sweet—
Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.
I will not quiver in the frailest bone,
You will not note a flicker of defeat;
My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,
My mouth give utterance to any moan.
The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;
Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.
Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,
Transforming me into a shape of flame.
I will come out, back to your world of tears,
A stronger soul within a finer frame.",October,1921,The Liberator,Max Eastman,Sonnet,male,,"Harlem Shadows, Survey Graphic, The New Negro",New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
Through Agony,Claude McKay,McKay,"I

All night, through the eternity of night,
Pain was my portion though I could not feel.
Deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel,
Till I was reft of even my inner light,
Till reason from my mind had taken flight,
And all my world went whirling in a reel.
And all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel,
A passive mass beneath your puny might.
Last night I gave you triumph over me,
So I should be myself as once before,
I marveled at your shallow mystery,
And haunted hungrily your temple door.
I gave you sum and substance to be free,
Oh, you shall never triumph any more!

II
I do not fear to face the fact and say,
How darkly-dull my living hours have grown,
My wounded heart sinks heavier than stone,
Because I loved you longer than a day!
I do not shame to turn myself away
From beckoning flowers beautifully blown,
To mourn your vivid memory alone
In mountain fastnesses austerely gray.
The mists will shroud me on the utter height,
The salty, brimming waters of my breast
Will mingle with the fresh dews of the night
To bathe my spirit hankering to rest.
But after sleep I’ll wake with greater might,
Once more to venture on the eternal quest.",December,1921,The Liberator,Max Eastman,Sonnet,male,,Harlem Shadows,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
Thirst,Claude McKay,McKay,"My spirit wails for water, water now!
My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot
For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough,
Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot.
My hungry body’s burning for a swim
In sunlit water where the air is cool,
As in Trout Valley where upon a limb
The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool.
Oh water, water, when the night is done,
When day steals gray-white through the window-pane,
Clear silver water when I wake, alone,
All impotent of parts, of fevered brain;
Pure water from a forest fountain first,
To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst!",December,1921,The Liberator,Max Eastman,Sonnet,male,,Harlem Shadows,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
Jasmines,Claude McKay,McKay,"Your scent is in the room.
Swiftly it overwhelms and conquers me!
Jasmines, night jasmines, perfect of perfume,
Heavy with dew before the dawn of day!
Your face was in the mirror. I could see
You smile and vanish suddenly away,
Leaving behind the vestige of a tear.
Sad suffering face, from parting grown so dear!
Night jasmines cannot bloom in this cold place;
Without the street is wet and weird with snow;
The cold nude trees are tossing to and fro;
Too stormy is the night for your fond face,
For your low voice too loud the wind's mad roar.
But Oh, your scent --- jasmines, jasmines. that grow
Luxuriant, clustered round your cottage door!",August ,1921,The Liberator,"Max Eastman, Claude McKay",,male,,,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay
The Tropics in New York,Claude McKay ,McKay ,"Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,
Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,
Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs,
Set in the window, bringing memories
Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,
And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies
In benediction over nun-like hills.
My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze;
A wave of longing through my body swept,
And, hungry for the old, familiar ways,
I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.",March,1925,Survey Graphic,Alain Locke,,male,Travel-Migration-Great Migration,"Harlem Shadows, The New Negro",New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay

Midnight Thoughts,Clifford L. Miller,Miller,"Midnight thoughts are the mouse that gnaws all night;
Starts up strange sounds, when all stilly sounds subside;
Ever bolder, bolder grows his gnawing by night
To bore into oak wood a tight passage
To lead to some eery darker nook.
I gnaw tonight on life's deep mystery
While slumberers sleep, a sound, a sweet sleep.
My life is wood I strive to split, to splinter
To gnaw through all stubborn resistance a way
To the next room, darker and more mysterious.
I must whip up my heart while thoughts gnaw on,-
Thoughts that never weary of gnawing gnawing·
Mouse-like, they may eat through to find some food
In a spacious, sweet-smelling chamber.

So weary I of thoughts that gnaw all night.",June,1928,Saturday Evening Quill,Eugene Gordon,,male,,,,Predom. Black,
A Latter-Day Eden,Colonel Charles Young,Young,"It was a twentieth century eden, mine ;
A modern Adam, I; and for my Eve ,
God gave a winsome woman with senses fine
Who deemed the cloth -of-life of golden weave.
'Mid trees whereon hung riches, pleasur, glory,
Again thro ' eden's garden went we twain,
Care -free and gay as when in ancient story
The first fair Eve with Adam led the train
Of all the living down the vernal vales,
And threaded sun-flecked shadowed paths of paradise;
Or rested at the noon in those sweet - scented bowers
In trustful love, while drinking from each other's eyes
Mutual content and joy and happiness for hours .
The feast with plenty flower -crowned,
   Sweet music's most enchanting strain,
Dance with her deft and measured round ,
      And lays
         Of poet-praise
Were ours: and counted not as vain .
   Ah, eden days indeed ! days of delight
   That melted into golden mist at night !
We drank from selfish satisfaction's cup,
         Content , and toyed
With life's ideals . Drank the dregs (ah, sorry sup!)
         O fsin and cloyed.
Riches, success, soft ease , and luxury
Were our cup-bearers round our bounteous board ,
Disguised devil -gods, who from the tree
Of life made their wit-stealing wine and poured
For us a heaven-forbidden draught and smiled
While merriment amused and sense beguiled .
Then fled the joy, alack ! that filled the heart!
Saddened companions, see, we sit apart!
Oh, day of wrath ! alas, the fateful hour!
O'er all our eden blew a blighting wind
Stifling and sickening spirit , bird and flower ;
Sapping our souls , for we had sinned!—had sinned!
Dark sorrow's dismal night enwrapped us round,
Our once calm bosoms were despair's abode:
No balm for the soul's healing could be found!
Close by our bower the wraiths of unrest rode,
Unbridled fears were loosed , remorse was calling
From the dim distance ne'er-agains appalling .
I knew that naught in me with this fell state could cope,
So led my sickened love into the house of hope.
         And there ---ah, there:
         Gloom and despair!
   Clad in th' habiliments of woe,
      How helpless hope is lying,
   Her lamp of life is burning low,
      Her attendant sisters dying :
   Faith fainting , finds , alas ! too late
      Friendship's best bonds are interest,
   And gray -robed death she doth await,
      His coming deems a welcome guest.
   Love lifts her eyes to heaven in prayer
      While her brightest stars are paling ;
   But a gleam of blessing finds she there
      The earth's a place of wailing;
   ""Tho' the arms that clasped her yesterday
      When all the world was green and bright
   Are loosed and gone for aye -for aye ,
      Slinking away beneath the night .
Then pointed love aloft, her eyes in sorrowing gaze,
We heard an angel -voice from out a golden haze,
Say soft in accents soothing , gracious , kind ---
Delicious as sweet -scented south-land wind:
""Ah , man ! ah, woman ! for each wasted year
May you atone, God says !-But 'tis not here.
Forth from your eden ! Leave illusion land,
Go to the struggling poor , weep round the bier ,
The lowly lift and dry misfortune's tear !
Of every race, each is your brother man:
Try what your loving ministrations can.
Encourage him, remove oppression's heel ,
And with each daily doing learn to feel .
Work , man ! work, woman , without recompense ,
Nor expectant of reward or grateful sense!
Work for the land's uplifting , for the right :
For work alone leads back again to light.
God's law for restoration , earthly neighbor ,

That all the daring deed by our dear soldier done--
   Deeds done--
Up to the throne of God will rise in surging Throngs
Holding high hands to Heav'n to right a Race's wrongs,--

A Lullaby,Cora J. Ball Moten,Moten,"Dusky lashes droop and fall,
Night-winds whisper, night-birds call.
Close your tired sleepy eyes,
Earth is singing lullabies,
Kindly twilight shadows creep
O’er a world that longs for sleep,
Little dusky babe of mine
Close those sleepy eyes of thine,
Mother’s love will softly keep 
Watch above you while you sleep,
Cruel hate and deadly wrong
Cannot silence mother’s song
Though against thy soft brown cheek
She may hide her face and weep.
Sleep, brown baby, while you may
Peacefully, at close of day.
Oh, that mother’s love could guard,
Keep thee safe ‘neath watch and ward
From the cruelly deadly things 
That await thee while she sings.
Prejudice and cold white hate:
These, my baby, these, thy fate,
Little, gentle, trustful thing, 
Thus, these sobs, the while I sing.

Confine my singing to its ways 
Beyond the ways of man. 
 
No racial option narrows grief;
Pain is no patriot;

Cause my tutored heart a trace 
Of anguish any more. 
 
Before your pleasure made me wise, 
A simulacrum of disguise 
Masked the serpent and the dove; 
That I discern now hiss from coo, 
My heart's full gratitude to you, 
Lady I had learned to love. 
 
Before I knew love well I sang 
Many a polished pain and pang, 
With proper bardic zeal;

Has made them wounds may heal. ",December ,1927,Ebony and Topaz,Charles S. Johnson,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen

To bugle out beyond my sense 
That the fittest song of earth is a dirge,

The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Nor always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap ;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made eternally to weep.
The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
White stars is no less lovely being dark,
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall.

Dark gutter snipe, black sprawler-in-the-mud,

Her walk is like the replica
   Of some barbaric dance
Wherein the soul of Africa
   Is winged with arrogance.
And yet so light she steps across
   The ways her sure feet pass,
She does not dent the smoothest moss
   Or bend the thinnest grass.

Who cannot take his world for what it seems.
Aloof and lonely must he ever walk,
Plying a strange and unaccustomed tongue,
An alien to the daily round of talk,
Mute when the sordid songs of earth are sung.
This is the certain end his dream achieves:
To sweat his blood and prayers while others sleep,
To shoulder his own coffin up the steep,
Incredulous summit that shapes his doom

Am I uncertain that these alien skies
Do not our whole life measure and confine.

Deluged my soul with song; if it were meet
To love Life so, then Love will but complete

Threnody for a Brown Girl,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Weep not, you who love her --
What rebellious flow
Grief undams shall recover
Whom the gods bid go?
Sorrow rising like a wall,
Bitter, blasphemous --
What avails it to recall
Beauty back to us?

Think not this grave shall keep her,
This marriage-bed confine;
Death may dig it deep and deeper --
She shall climb it like a vine.
Body that was quick and sentient,
Dear as thought or speech,
Death could not, with one trenchant
Blow, snatch out of reach!

She is nearer than the word
Wasted on her now,
Nearer than the swaying bird
On its rhythmic bough.
Only were our faith as much
As a mustard seed,
Aching hungry hands might touch
Her as they touch a reed.

Life, who was not loth to trade
Her unto death, has done
Better than he planned, has made
Her wise as Solomon.
Now she knows the Why and Wherefore,
Troublous Whence and Whither;
Why men strive and sweat, and care for
Bays that droop and wither.

All the stars she knows by name,
End and origin thereof,
Knows if love be kin to shame,
If shame be less than love.
What was crooked now is straight,
What was rough is plain;
Grief and sorrow have no weight
Now to cause her pain.

One to her are flame and frost;
Silence is her singing lark.
We alone are children -- lost,
Crying in the dark.
Varied features now, and form
Change has bred upon her;
Crush no bug or nauseous worm
Lest you tread upon her.

Pluck no flower lest she scream;
Bruise no slender reed
Lest it prove more than it seem,
Lest she groan and bleed.
More than ever trust your brother,
Read him golden, pure --
It may be she finds no other
House so safe and sure.

Set no poet carving
Rhymes to make her laugh;
Only live hearts starving
Need an epitaph.
Lay upon her no white stone
From a foreign quarry;
Earth and sky, be these alone
Her obituary.

Swift as a startled fawn or swallow,
Silence all her sound,
She has fled; we cannot follow
Further than this mound.
We who take the beaten track,
Trying to appease
Hearts near breaking with their lack,
We need elegies.

Heritage,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea, 
Jungle star or jungle track,
Strong bronzed men, or regal black
Women from whose loins I sprang
When the birds of Eden sang?
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who all day long
Want no sound except the song
Sung by wild barbaric birds
Goading massive jungle herds,
Juggernauts of flesh that pass
Trampling tall defiant grass
Where young forest lovers lie,
Plighting troth beneath the sky.
So I lie, who always hear,
Though I cram against my ear
Both my thumbs, and keep them there,
Great drums throbbing through the air.
So I lie, whose fount of pride,
Dear distress, and joy allied ,
Is my somber flesh and skin,
With the dark blood dammed within
Like great pulsing tides of wine
That, I fear, must burst the fine
Channels of the chafing net
Where they surge and foam and fret.
Africa? A book one thumbs
Listlessly, till slumber comes.
Unremembered are her bats
Circling through the night, her cats
Crouching in the river reeds,
Stalking gentle flesh that feeds
By the river brink ; no more
Does the bugle- throated roar
Cry that monarch claws have leapt
From the scabbards where they slept.
Silver snakes that once a year
Doff the lovely coats you wear,
Seek no covert in your fear
Lest a mortal eye should see;
What's your nakedness to me?
Here no leprous flowers rear
Fierce corollas in the air;
Here no bodies sleek and wet,
Dripping mingled rain and sweat,
Tread the savage measures of
Jungle boys and girls in love.
What is last year's snow to me,
Last year's anything? The tree
Budding yearly must forget
How its past arose or set--
Bough and blossom, flower, fruit,
Even what shy bird with mute
Wonder at her travail there,
Meekly labored in its hair.
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who find no peace
Night or day, no slight release
From the unremittant beat
Made by cruel padded feet
Walking through my body's street.
Up and down they go, and back,
Treading out a jungle track.
So I lie, who never quite
Safely sleep from rain at night
I can never rest at all
When the rain begins to fall;
Like a soul gone mad with pain
I must match its weird refrain;
Ever must I twist and squirm,
Writhing like a baited worm ,
While its primal measures drip
Through my body, crying, ""Strip!
Doff this new exuberance.
Come and dance the Lover's Dance!""
In an old remembered way
Rain works on me night and day.
Quaint, outlandish heathen gods
Black men fashion out of rods,
Clay, and brittle bits of stone,
In a likeness like their own,
My conversion came high-priced;
I belong to Jesus Christ,
Preacher of humility;
Heathen gods are naught to me.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
So I make an idle boast;

Lamb of God, although I speak
With my mouth thus, in my heart
Do I play a double part.
Ever at Thy glowing altar
sick and falter,
Wishing He I served were black,
Thinking then it would not lack
Precedent of pain to guide it,
Must my heart grow
Let who would or might deride it;
Surely then this flesh would know
Yours had borne a kindred woe.
Lord, I fashion dark gods, too,
Daring even to give You
Dark despairing features where,
Crowned with dark rebellious hair,
Patience wavers just so much as
Mortal grief compels, while touches
Quick and hot, of anger, rise
To smitten cheek and weary eyes.
Lord, forgive me if my need
Sometimes shapes a human creed.
All day long and all night through,
One thing only must I do:
Quench my pride and cool my blood,
Lest I perish in the flood.
Lest a hidden ember set
Timber that I thought was wet
Burning like the dryest flax,
Melting like the merest wax,
Lest the grave restore its dead.

In the least way realized

An Old Story ,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"“I must be ready when he comes,” she said,
“Besieger of the heart, the long adored;
And I shall know him by his regal tread,
And by the grace peculiar to my lord.
Upon my mouth his lips shall be a sword;
Splendid is he by whom this breast shall fall,
This hive of honey burst, this fruit be cored.”
So beauty that would be a willing thrall
Kept vigil, eyes aglow, ear tuned to hear his call.
Had she not had her dream, she might have seen
For what he was the stranger at her gate,
And known his rugged hands, strong mouth, and lean
Hawk-face spelled out for her a star-spun fate.
But captive to a dream she let him wait
In vain for any word she might have said
Whereat he might declare himself her mate.
She looked him through as one unknown or dead;
He passed, an unseen halo blazing round his head.
The grave will be her only lover now,
Though still she watches for the shining one,
Her prince in purple robes, with flaming brow,
Astride a wild steed lineaged from the sun.
Season to season shades, the long days run
To longer years; she still is waiting there,
Not knowing long ago her siege was done,
Not dreaming it has been her bitter share
To entertain her heart’s high guest all unaware.",May,1927,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,,male,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen
Dad,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"His ways are circumspect and bound
With trite simplicities;
His is the grace of comforts found
In homely hearthside ease.
His words are sage and fall with care,
Because he loves me so;
And being his, he knows, I fear,
The dizzy path I go.
For he was once as young as I,
As prone to take the trail,
To find delight in the sea’s low cry,
And a lone wind’s lonely wail.
It is his eyes that tell me most
How full his life has been;
There lingers there the faintest ghost
Of some still sacred sin.
So I must quaff Life’s crazy wine,
And taste the gall and dregs;
And I must spend this wealth of mine,
Of vagrant wistful legs;
And I must follow, follow, follow
The lure of a silver horn,
That echoes from a leafy hollow,
Where the dreams of youth are born.
Then when the star has shed its gleam,
The rose its crimson coat;
When Beauty flees the hidden dream,
And Pan’s pipes blow no note;
When both my shoes are worn too thin,
My weight of fire to bear,
I’ll turn like dad, and like him win
The peace of a snug arm-chair.

To mitigate his own pain’s fiery glow.   
Man could but little proffer in exchange   
Save that his cages have a larger range.

Has in some man his human counterpart,
Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped,   
But in the stifling flesh securely trapped.

Three Hundred Years Ago,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Three hundred years ago there was a land
   And two who moved
With one fair thought: meet hand in hand,
   And to be loved.
Then came a ship and strange, pale men
   Who gave me drink
That made me sleep; I woke -- and then -- 
   The broken link.
I am nost sure that you were moved
  At all, or wept;
For you were young and much beloved --
   Perhaps you slept.
But there was blood, and sweat, and hell,
   And tears for me,
Till one whose voice was like a bell
   Said, 'Go, be free!'
The chains were off, but other things
   Still held me slave:
A stretch of land where gray sand clings
   To a warm white wave.
But more than this, there was yoru face,
   Beautiful and wise--
Oh, I have sought them every place,
   Your face and eyes.
Three hundred years ago, and yet 
   A day ago;
There still the red suns flare and set,
   The dark winds blow.

And will the flame burn steady to the end,
Until we round that dark and dangerous bend
Where.there is such a crying need for light;
Or will it flare up now so clear and bright,
Sunlike its wealth so far and wide distend
That nothing will remain for us to spend
When toll is taken by the dismal night?
Why shculd I harrow up my mind like this, 
To tarnish with a doubt each golden kiss?

Us now from any hidden darkness spun;
Sufficient to the day let be the sun,
And to the night the spear-points of the stars.

By COUNTEE CULLEN

Cnce in a thousand years a call may ring
Divested so of every cumbering lie
A man espousing it may fight and sing,
And count it but a little thing to die;
Once in a thousand years a star may come
Six-pointed, tipped with such an astral flow
It’s singing sisters must bow hushed dumb,
Half-mutinous, yet half-adoring show;
Once in as many years a man may rise
So cosmopolitan of thought and speech,
Humanity reflected in his eyes,
His heart a haven every race may reach,
That doubters shall receive a mortal thrust,
And own “This man proves flesh exalts its dust”.

Road Song,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"This will I say today,
Let no tomorrow come;
Thy words are singing birds
That strike my faint lyre dumb.

This will I vow thee now,
Lest vows should go unsaid:
Thou art unto my heart
A song to wake the dead.

This oath I take to break
When falls the lover's code:
To fare as thou, and share
With thee each winding road.

Thus do I deal my seal,
No alien one may break:
Thy mouth to mine as south
The long lone trail we take.

Lament,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Now let all lovely things embark
Upon the sea of mist
With her whose luscious mouth the dark,
Grim troubadour has kissed.

The silver clock that ticked away
Her days, and never knew
Its beats were sword thrusts to the clay
That too much beauty slew.

The pillow favored with her tears
And hallowed by her head;
I shall not even keep my fears,
Now their concern is dead.

But where shall I bury sun and rain,
How mortalise the stars,
How still the half-heard cries of pain
That seared her soul with scars?

In what sea depths shall all the seeds
Of every flower die?
Where shall I scatter the broken reeds,
And how erase the sky?

And where shall I find a hole so deep
No troubled ghost may rise?
There will I put my heart to sleep
Wanting her face and eyes.

Night Rain,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"I wake to the sound of a soft, low patter
That comes like sudden news,
Or like the slow, uncadenced clatter
Of well-filled wooden shoes.
I know I have not waked for long,
That I shall dream again,
that God has sent a slumber song
Of dew and drowsy rain.
I hear it rush the willows through,
And strike the garden gate;
Far off a love bird's plaintive coo
Is answered of its mate.
The night rain works a subtle charm
Day showers never know;
It make me burrow deep and warm
Beneath my sheets of snow.
It brims the pansy's eager cup,
It dives to the oak's dank roots,
Inquisitive, meanders up,
And climbs the newest shoots.
It drips a melancholy tune,
As plunging fierce and deep,
It scurries wild across the moon
To steep my eyes in sleep. ",February ,1925,The Crisis,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset",Quatrain,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen
Sweethearts,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"They talk the silent night away,
   But speak no word by day;
One is a cedar trim and tall,
   His love a willow small.
The one stands proud with head held high,
   The other, coyly shy;
The cedar's limbs are hard and strong;
   The willow's voice is song.
By day when she would love to talk
   Across the garden walk, 
The cedar's rude as rude can be,
   Pretending not to see;
And then the willow turns away,
   And sulks throughout the day;
Sometimes she gives a little sigh,
   And once I saw her cry.
At night when our harsh words are said,
   And I am in my bed,
I hear in sweetest harmonies
   The language of those trees. 
I find the ivied balcony,
   Where through the gloom I see 
Two sweethearts in the yard below
   Whose speech all lovers know. ",December,1923,The Crisis,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset",,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen
If Love be Staunch,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"If love be staunch, call mountains brittle;
Love is a thing will live
So long, my dear,—oh, just the little
While water stays in a sieve.

Yea, love is deathless as the day
Whose death the stars reveal;
And love is loyal all the way,
If treachery be leal.

Beyond the shadow of a doubt,
No thing is sweet as love,
But, oh, the bitterness spewed out
Of the heart at the end thereof!

Beyond all cavil or complaint,
Love’s ways are double-dyed;
Beneath the surplice of a saint
The cloven hooves are spied.
Whom yesterday love rhymed his sun
Today he names a star;
When the course of another day is run,
What will he say you are?

The Voice of the Negro ,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"Stop! O, Nation, stop and listen!
Listen with your heart and brain,
Hear the weird Voice of the Negro,
Coming up from Southern plain :
From the brakes of Louisiana,
From the fields of whit’ning grain,
From the lees of Mississippi,
Listen, as it comes again.

Not for social recognition,
Not for alms this Voice is rife.
For this, and only this 'tis pleading--
A man's chance in the race of life.
For an equal chance to labor,
And honest pay for honest toil;
Give this, and by the God who made us,
We'll win success on Southern soil. 

We still have hope, tho' darkness lowers,
And tbunders spread their dread alarms;
Faith in the best blood of the Southland,
Faith in the strength of our own arms,
Faith in the truth, tbo’crushed and bleeding;
That justice in man's heart still dwells,
We'll kiss the rod, then rise and labor,
God reigns above, and all is well.",February,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Labor, Progress and Racial Uplift",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/daniel-webster-davis

Lament ,Donald Jeffrey Hayes,Hayes,"I draw the purple folds of iniquity about me
And lay me down in the golden shadow of His Word
As upon a couch of many cushions. . . .
And the vanity of my heart
Is as gall upon my lips.
Yet is my sinfulness before me
Even as the vision of my looking. . . .
And though I humble my voice to pour forth
Praise and thanksgiving into His Presence,
Yet do my feet hunger for the paths of wrongdoing. . . .
And my fingers for the softness of evil. . . .
And I am like the black stone
That is neither fuel nor rock,
Anxious to add glowing to the burning Fire,
Yet made to feel the rushing of cool waters over its darkness. . . .
And I am like the bird born with cripple wing-
Longing to fly . . . yet knowing only the pulling of lush grasses
At its foot. . . .

Nor in the sanctity of Righteousness. . . . ",May,1928,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,,male,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://poets.org/poet/donald-jeffrey-hayes

Leading to the requiem.

Hymn to America,E. Lucien Waithe,Waithe,"America I sing to you
A hymn of love mixed with my tears,
A hymn made up of thoughts that spring
From many, many cruel years.
I love you my America
Who would not want to call me yours ;
With all the wrongs that hemmed me in
I stood up to defend your doors.
Before I knew time, place, or scene,
My mother kept before my view
Your emblem lighted with the stars,
Which I still saw there as I grew.
And when I saw out in the bay
Shining above all other glare
The light that burns throughout the night,
I smiled and said I need not fear.
I thought it then a light to love,
To liberty and every good ;
But that was false — a light to hell
I found it soon after I stood
Upon the hill where Life took me
To view the things that are as rare,
To feel the teeth of poverty
And pull at opportunity's bar.
I had high hopes, bright dreams were mine,
A future roseate as the light
That limns the shadows of the hills
Against the sky as dawn grows bright.
Too soon hate's dark eclipse hid all
The brightness of this day of hope;
And your weak pride narrowed and bound
My every effort, every scope.
But still America I lived
Scourged by the jeers, the taunts, the scorn ;
Why should some men inherit love
And some to such strong hate be born ?
America I pay with love
For all the hate you give to me;
I take your jagged-edge cup and drink
The drug of dark hate fearlessly.
I know it can but drug the sense.
And hold ambition to the earth ;
For hate can never conquer me,
Nor wrong rob me of all my mirth.
I shall still cry, shall laugh and play
Until some larger heart should come
To light yours into flames of love
That burn for all and not for some.
And still a dream is in my soul
In which I see you handing me
A golden star of membership
In this great world's fraternity.
Then from the ruins of much wrong,
Within the shining shop of right
I'll forge for you a tower wherefrom
Shall gleam earth's purest brightest light.
Then all the nations of this world
Shall look to you and call you great ;
Because your light shall shine afar
When one large love replaces hate. ",August,1925,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,male,"Racism, America",,New York,Predom. Black,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40654465
Africa--A Medley,E.L. Blackshear,Blackshear,"Her limbs in chain
From cross the Main
By Slaver brought
To Freedom's shore,
By art untaught,
Of savage Lore,
And simple thought--
   Africa.

Of massive frame,
Of patient mood,
She reeks no blame, 
But wears her yoke--
For others' good.
To plow, to hoe,
To sing, to sow,
To plant, to toil
On others' soil--
   Africa.

In cotton rag,
With cotton bag,
To pick the boll,
And sing the while,
From dawn to dark.
In cabin bare,
A Spartan's fare,
She waits till dawn--
   Africa

Her fetich lore
Here now forgot,
She learns to pray
Her captor's way--
To laugh, to speak,
To jest, to weep,
In Freedom's land--
   Africa. 

To raise her brood,
To chew her cud,
In Stoic mood-
The under sill,
The stone as mill,
She waits on God-
(And Appomattox)
   Africa.

Black shoulders bare,
The burden there
A Nation's load-
She tills—and toils,
Nor reçks of spoil,
Enduring all-
This Atlas-
   Africa. 

Her heart grew warm
As her skin was black,
And of love for her captors
In that heart was no lack.
And she loved her own,
And still loved them
For the milk of her kindness
O'erflowed at the brim.
Then the land grew angry
And the lightnings flashed,
Of the cannon's mouthings
And the bayonet's dash.
Then the land was still
And the soil was red
As silent and mourning
They huried their dead.

But God heard her prayer and God heard her song
In the wide field of cotton and the corn rows long,
For He moved on His throne and His bright glory shone,
For in all His wide Dominions shall His will be done.

Then Africa looked to the God of her trust
And wept for she felt that her God was just-
Then Africa looked in the face of her brood,
And rejoiced for she felt that God was good.",March,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Africa, Labor, Slavery, Religion",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,

Thinking I'll fall, you cheap-skate!
Well, you've got me dead wrong, see?

Introspection,Edward S. Silvera,Silvera,"Whence have we come?
We know but that
God made man,
And that Africa is a land of jungies–
We know too 
That nights have been dark
And like a million stars
We have grinned
Thru them all.

It is strange
That we should know Love,
We who have gasped for breath
Amid poisonous fumes of hate
And have sucked
The bitter breast of scorn;
It is strange
That we too
Should know the joy
Of kisses.

Our mouths have sung
The Lord’s song
In a strange land,
And our harp strings have vibrated
With new tunes.

We must find a new prayer
To pray,
The same words have grown dull 
To the ears of God:
We must find a new prayer 
For the God of the sun 
And steel girders,
We must build stronger altars
To the God of skyscrapers.

How quickly this dream has ended!
Palm trees are waving
On the banks of the Congo
Where grass huts still hide dusky bodies
From the sun;
And there are voices
Crying aloud in the wilderness—
There are voices in the jungles 
That echo thru the night
As ours did

Happiness and Death,Edward S. Silvera,Silvera,"Happiness

I went in quest of happiness
Upon a golden mountain
But she was in the plain below
Beside the public fountain.

I sought her in the sea-blue waves
And singing sun-lit billows
But she was in the placid stream
Beneath the shady willows.

I looked for her in city crowds
That filled the great white way
But found her on a lowly farm,
A milkmaid, tawny, gay.

Death

My heart keeps a knockin’,—
   Thump, thump, thump.
My heart keeps a knockin',--

Then my heart ain’t gonna knock no more
An’ there won’t be no thump, thump, thump
An’ there won’t be no bump, bump, bump.

Their glory mingled with the dust,
Their archives stained with crime and lust;
And all that breathed of pomp and pride,
Like the untimely fig, has died.
On thing, alone, restrains, exalts
A nation and corrects its faults;
One thin, alone, its life can crown
And give its destiny renown.
That nation, then, is truly great,
That lives by love, and not by hate;
That bends beneath the chastening rod,
That owns the truth, and looks to God!

For the tenuous touch that carved the portion,
And wrought apart the place unchanging

And known its shape on silk and blinding page;
Been inset with the gems of burning jewels
By artisans who swing again th disk
On wings outspread, which sweep e'en centuries by!

When time and the russet mummy are lost in abyss,
And symbols and sun disk shall no longer bind death

Who wake to a birdless dawn,
Who know of no meadow that waits for them,
No pool with its dragon flies
All bathed with the silver of morning light
Like the lights that flash on the pool,
When I think of that trystless waking today—
So far as to meadows and meads,
So far as to tossing billows of wheat,
So far as to millet tides,
So far as to orchards and woods to seek
To swing from the kind sweet trees—
I fear that the dawn’s too rich for my share.
I fear I have robbed some child
Of the fragrance of dew,
Of the birds’ first notes,
Of the warm kind light from God—
All sent in tints of nasturtium blooms—
For the little red hearts of childhood.

Negro Street Serenade (In the South),Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"The quavering zigzag of the fiddle’s notes;
The thumping “tum-tum” of the banjo and guitar;
The gauzy quiver, flutter of the fiddle;
The measured muffled thud of that guitar!
And then a voice breaks forth—
Loose, careless, mellow—
A wealth of voice that rolls, soars,
Rolls and falls,
A reveling, rich voice,
Deeper than the banjo’s;
With more of melody than fiddles’ trebles,
Yet with that subtle minor trembling through 
Which shakes the viol’s slender vibrance
As the winds might—
And all of this out in a half-hushed autumn dusk!
The autumn air itself is tense, suspended,
And into this that most spontaneous song!
Which ripples on and floats and floats
Midst “thum” of banjo
And rhythmic background of that constant taut guitar,
And travels with the wavers of the fiddle,
To float and rise and rest with moon and star!

The Bird in the Cage,Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"The Bird in the Cage

This poem received Honorable Mention in The Crisis Prize contest of 1926.

I AM not better than my brother over the way,
But he has a bird in the cage and I have not,
It beats its little fretted green wings
Against the wires of its prison all day long.
Backward and forward it leaps,
While summer air is tender and the shadows of leaves
Rock on the ground,
And the earth is cool and heated in spots,
And the air from rich herbage rises teeming,
And gold of suns spills all around,
And birds within the maples
And birds upon the oaks fly and sing and flutter.
And there is that little green prisoner,
Tossing its body forward and up,
Backward and forth mechanically!
I listen for its hungry little song,
Which comes unsatisfying,
Like drops of dew dispelled by drought
O, rose bud doomed to ripen in a bud vase!
O, bird of song within that binding cage!
Nay, I am not better than my brother over the way,
Only he has a bird in a cage and I have not.

At the Pool,Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"At the Pool
EFFIE LEE NEWSOME

LIKE to stand right still awhile
Beside some forest pool.
The reeds around it smell so fresh,
The waters look so cool!
Sometimes I just hop in and wade,
And have a lot of fun,
Playing with bugs that dart across
The water in the sun.

They lodge here at this little pool—
All sorts ef bugs and things
That hop about its shady banks,
Or dart along with wings,
Or ‘scamper on the water top,
As water-striders go,
Or strange back-swimmers upside down,
Using their legs to row,
Or the stiff, flashing dragon flies,
The gentle damoiselle,
The clumsy, sturdy water-bugs,
And scorpions as well,
That come on top to get fresh air
From homes beneath the pool,
Where water-boatmen have their nooks,
On pebbles, as a rule.

And then, behold! Kingfisher comes,
That great big royal bird!
To him what is the dragon fly
That. kept the pool life stirred?
Or water-tigers terrible
That murder bugs all day?
Kingfisher comes, and each of these
Would hide itself away!

He swoops and swallows what he will,
A stone-fly or a frog.
Wing’d things rush frightened through the air,
Others to hole and log.
The little pool that held them all
I watch grow very bare,
But fisher knows his hide and seek—
He’ll find some one somewhere!

Morning Light,Effie Lee Newsome (Mary Effie Lee),Newsome,"(The Dew-drier)

It is a custom in some parts of Africa for travelers into the jungles to send before them in the early morning little African boys called “Dew-driers” to brush with their bodies the dew from the high grasses—and be, perchance, the first to meet the leopard’s or hyena’s challenge—and so open the road. “Human Brooms,” Dan Crawford calls them.

Brother to the firefly—
For as the firefly lights the night
So lights he the morning—
Bathed in the dank dews as he goes forth
Through heavy menace and mystery
Of half-waking tropic dawns,
Behold a little black boy, a naked black boy,
Sweeping aside with his slight frame
Night’s pregnant tears,
And making a morning path to the light
For the tropic traveler!

Bathed in the blood of battle,
Treading toward a new morning,
May not his race—its body long bared to the world’s disdain,
Its face schooled to smile for a light to come—
May not his race, even as the dew-boy leads,
Bear onward the world toward a new day-dawn
When tolerance, forgiveness,
Such as reigned in the heart of One
Whose heart was gold,
Shall shape the earth for that fresh dawning
     After the dews of blood?

The New Negro,Elsie Taylore Du Trieuille,Du Trieuille,"“Hey there, Bub! I say!”
Silence. (“He knows my name.’’)
“Hey George! This way!”
Silence. (“Same, old, game.”)
“Hey, darky! You!!”
Silence. (“Same, old game.” )
“T’ll be damned if tain’t true!
Nigger showing off, posing offense
At a name. Do you think I’d ‘Mister’ you!
Black beast! Any name
For you'd be an honor. Who
Looks at you, sees a cringing, tame 
Beast. Intelligence! Bah!
Blunt as pig iron. Black soul!
What’s in you to respect! Ha!
Ha! I could take the whole
Of your race and dam the oceans with its refuse!
Stinking flotsam! Black beast!
God! Who has use
For your carcass!”

So, at least,
Was this white man’s thought.

But out of this stinking flotsam, God
Wrought a young knighthood.
Sworn to their vows, with flashing sword
And dazzling shield, they stood—
A new order of Negro Youth, eager
For the quest of the Guarded Heights,
God bade them, “Go forward! No meager
Whims of men shall put to flight
Your soul’s great force. Wear
My favors, Vision and Love.
Evil shall glower, a few shall dare
To mock; but steadfast above
All pettiness, you shall stand.

“New Negro, sing your soul's own song,
Holy, majestic, grand.
Your notes shall lead a jeering throng
From baseness to nobility.
Dip your gilt-edged pen in the wellspring
Of your heart. With swift agility,
Fling word on word to pierce and sting
As the rapier thrust, men’s hearts.
Your daring pen shall slowly lessen
Studied, insidious plots
Of prejudice and inhuman oppression.
Open the flood-gate of your vivid soul.
On crested waves of creative
Genius, unveiled beauty shall roll
Forth, to transform, to give
New life to barren canvass. Men
Shall gaze astounded and their
Eager hands shall reach out then,
Not to despoil, but to share,
To possess the lofty inspiration
Pure art alone can give.

“New Negro, in this generation
You shall fully live.
‘The old order changeth’. Not
Mold of face, nor color of skin
Shall conquer the cruel heart
Of race tyranny, or bigotry, its kin.
They shall perish by your flashing sword
Of ability. Your shield, brightly 
Emblazoned with fine achievement, shall afford
Invulnerable armor for unsightly
Barbs of asinine abuse. Knights
Of the order of New Negro Youth,
You shall reach the Guarded Heights 
With weapons of integrity and truth.”

Fettered Liberty,Esther A. Yates ,Yates,"To come so near, and yet not touch the goal!
   To sight!
Its gleaming bars, like some pale pilgrim soul 
      Hails light,
   After the weary night.
To feel the unbounded joy! My efforts crowned
   At last!

Then strive to leap, and find my feet are bound,
      And fast;
   My short-lived freedom past!
To see my fond hopes crumble as do things In dreams; 
My skin a burden that should serve as wings!
      It seems 
   The earth with passion teems!

To live with the books, to teach my eager brain
      To act,
And every noble power and gift to train 
      With tact–
   Then meet this time-worn fact:

That prejudicial bars rise everywhere.
      My race,
My barrier. For this my soul must bear
      Disgrace,
   And opposition face. 

How long shall I restrain the hot life-tide
      Whose flow
With just resentment surges? Must I bide 
      This blow?
And this? And this? And fearful hide?
      And cringing terror show?

Or shall I let the prejudice of  years 
      Go by,
With outward passivness, and inward tears,
      And die? 
Or leave unsatisfied my tears,
      Nor even question why?

And this is freedom? This is liberty?
      The place
Where justice reigns? “Home of the brave and and free”?
      Look! Trace
The deepened furrows of servility 
      Upon a burdened race!

Jehovah, burn into our faith’s weak ray
      Thy might.
We crave but half a chance to blaze a way 
      To light,
   To dawn, from racial night.

God of a trampled race! We must, we dare
      Be free!
Free, that we may be men! We leave our fare

Long Remembering,Ethel Caution Davis,Davis,"If  I should go to sleep to-night
Knowing I ne'er should waken,
I would not be dismayed.
My soul, glad for release ,
Would wing its way unto a long remembering

Of mornings spent upon the Siasconsett strand
Watching the sun rise
Dripping red spray from ocean's eastern rim.
Of hours on Narragansett's craggy coast
When, perched in solitude upon a rock,
Feet dipping in the spray,
I listened to the waves
Beat their high sounding paean on the shore.

Of evenings in mid-ocean when the moon
Laddered its path of gold
From sky down o'er the waves
To where I stood ship-bound
Trying to quench undying thirst
With wonder of the night.

Of dusk in distant balsam wood
When nature poured her evensong
From thrushes ' throat.

Of moments with a cardinal—
He perched upon a swaying pine ,

I tip-toe on the sod—
Talking to each other of happiness and God.

Of blue flags by a Carolina stream,
Of dogwood tracing petals pink
Against a silver sky.

Of flowers peeping through June snow at Scheideg;
Of Spietz reflected in the Thunensee;
Of English gardens
And purple heather hemming in the Scottish lochs

Of Capri's grotto blue
And cedars silhouetted against the Carmel sea.
Of lacy spires etched against the sky
Of Chartres and Senlis, St. Patrick's and Milan.

Of music in a child's unstudied laughter;
Of unexpected handclasps by the way.

If I should go to sleep to-night
Knowing I ne'er should waken
I would not be dismayed.

Clothed only in such robes as these
Would wing its way into Eternity
Asking that afterlife be long enough
For such remembering.

In Respect to Marcus Garvey (1921),Ethel Trew Dunlap,Dunlap,"He loosed the shackles from the hand
Bound for three-hundred years.

‘Til millions sent up cheers.
 
He led his race out from the tomb
Of darkness and despair.
That crushed hopes might revive and bloom
In liberty’s pure air.
 
He did not heed the cynic’s sneer--
His soul fell in a dream.
And critics could not hush the lips
That spoke of freedom’s theme.
 
He saw his mother country free--
Behold her rising star.
And begged his countrymen to flee
Where kin and loved ones are.
 
Inspired by God, one hundred years
Became to him a day:
He saw his kinsmen, heard their cry
When future tyrants sway.
 
He saw them swept like driven tide
To Canada’s retreat,
Confined there by the ocean bars,
And trampled under feet.
 
He saw his people pass away
Like clouds that tempests rend.
While idlers criticised and smiled,
He was the black man’s friend.
 
Fired with a patriotic zeal
That fanned his loving heart.
He yearned his native land ties
That aliens tore apart.

A nation yet unborn--
A land where black men might be free,
The dawn of freedom’s morn.

And set their country free.

Portrait of an Old Woman,F. Marshall Davis,Davis,"Leather skin of a tom-tom
stretched loosely
over dried marrowless bones
then painted with a brown
the color of parched corn
old and bent
like the hands
of the town clock
at two minutes past six
eyes the color of
weatherbeaten brown calico
and with just that much brilliance
born working
will go out the same way
she had a son
he is now doing time
at Leavenworth 
for bootlegging
her tomorrow
is like her today
yet she can sing
of a Saviour Jesus
who washed away
the sins of the world
and left her white as snow
of a rest that will come in
the Great Beyond.
What a tragedy it would be
if she were mistaken.

" ""War Profiles"" ",Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"I

THE breath of the harvest is in the air. The boys of Ethiopia, khaki clad, are bidding farewell to the city of their love. They are swinging the corner to the tune of 

""John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, 
But his soul goes marching on.""

We men and women of Ethiopia are waving handkerchiefs and moistening our cheeks with tear drops. It is farewell time for our young life. 

How many of these that walk so proudly behind the flag of Appomattox will the warm earth of France receive? How many will be dust to keep alive the lilies? 

Ethiopia is paying her debt to the nation that gave the world Dumas. 

II

Toussaint, old man of the mountains, is tramping the streets of Port au Prince.

""Whither do you go, Graybeard?"" challenges the sentry. 

Toussaint's voice is soft and low.

""I go to arouse the sleeping men of Ethiopia. 

""This is the hour that tries the nations and the races. 

""War is a young man's glory, an old man's remembrance.

""France is bowed in desolation. To her I dedicate the young men of my blood that she might be saved from the claw of the vulture.

""Fear not, land that exalted Bonaparte! Toussaint hears thy call.""

III

How desolate is State Street, now that war has come upon the land!

How desolate the Cabaret. Who can be gay now that the young are about to die? The pavement of a street that once held rendezvous with music is wet with tears of those who have given loved ones to the cause. 

No longer walk the merchant, lawyer, doctor, thief and toiler along the lighted path of this merry thoroughfare. The khaki makes all men one. 

Old men are peddling dreams of a new Ethiopia; old women and young women long for the laughter of State Street grown sober. 

On with lights! Death, the new jester, holds the heart of my people in the hollow of his hand. 

IV

The Armory is silent beneath a firmament of gray. 

No longer the young men bombard its walls the laughter of youth. 

The young girls, brown as the autumn landscape or yellow as the noonday glow, pass by, lonely and dejected. 

How many Novembers, how many Decembers will die before laughter again runs riot?

V

God heard his children in the night.

God turned to him who sits on His right hand and said: 

""What is this, like the wailing of music, that reaches my throne? 

""'Tis the children of the oppressed crying for succor, I have heard their prayer night and day. 

""Ethiopia is in pain, Israel is bleeding, Poland is no more, India is weary of the strange gods that infest her groves. The tomb of my Son is desecrated and Jerusalem is the dwelling place of Gentiles.

""Man has grown arrogant. The beast on him is not yet dead.

""Go, Thou Angel of Wrath, into the four corners of the earth and spill the seeds of discord!

""Freedom shall prevail""

The Angel of Wrath is riding the winds of the earth. Look up, Ethiopia, and be comforted!

The Mother o' Dusk and Her Babe,Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"I look and that I see appeals to me
As does the manger Babe to Christian man,
For she who mothered long another’s brood
Upon her lap in rapture holds a child
That came from deep travail to claim her love.

Upon its lips she prints a deathless kiss
And holds against her breast its trembling form 
And through the night she croons a strange old song
That tells the world, “Behold, I have my own.”

For she is mother now, that once was such
A cruel world with jibes derided her
And asked her, “Where are those you brought to light?
Where all those hopes you said were yours to give?”

I hear this turbaned mother plead, “O world, 
My hopes have shaped themselves in flesh o’ brown
And all my deeds have given light to eyes
That grasp its infant hour of wonderment.
Take now my suckling, let it live for thee
And when its manhood breaks its spirit’s bound
It shall defend thee, succour thee and love
The good that through the ages thou hast served.”

And when the child in sleep would close its eyes
This strong young mother lifts with tenderness
This proselyte to all the joys and woes
An ancient world would give to test its own
And lays it snug within its trundle bed
And lets the moonlight play upon its form.

Sweet Love O' Dusk,Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"Bespangled and dipt in fire of stars the robe
I wrap around my aching form and lie
In ecstacy beneath the world-old skies
And stretch my arms to those who lost my love
When they would seek a mine that held the gods
Of every pagan realm; and through my veins
The ancient warmth diffuses riotous
And eager for eternal cooling breath.

For I who wandered through a maze of curse
And knew the scorn of those I strove to aid
Have found a newer realm, a sacred grove
Where I can woo that star-crowned maid of dusk
Who brought to light a brood of sorrow folk
And place on her a wedding ring of flowers
That none but God can break.

Tis good to know
She walks and chants her songs no man can sing
And hear her voice in every scented breeze; 
For she has waited long that I should come
And hid herself among a faithful few
In cave whose seal responds to magic’s charm.
But now that starry scented night has dropt 
To earth she glides to me and clasps me hard
And presses on my lips a natal kiss
And bids me let the curses die; for man
Can weave no curse that lives, nor stay sweet love. 

I revel here a thousand thousand nights
And elves do dance around my wedding couch 
And ever in my arms the maid o’dusk
And ever in my dreams her tender love
That guides me o'er a thousand thousand streams.

Then blow your pipes and let your minstrelsy
Bloom golden ’neath a starry canopy;
For all the years have come and death is cold
And wrapt in shroud and laid in catacomb.

To All of You

My little stone
Sinks quickly Into the bosom of this deep, dark pool
Of oblivion...
I have troubled its breast but little.
Yet those far shores
That knew me not
Will feel the fleeting, furtive kiss
Of my tiny concentric ripples.... 

To Lewellyn

You have borne full well
The burden of my friendship—
I have drunk deep
At your crystal pool,
And in return
I have-polluted its waters
With the bile of my hatred,
I have flooded your soul
With tortuous thoughts,
I have played Iscariot
To your Pythias... 

To Mother 

I came In the blinding sweep
Of ecstatic pain,
I go In the throbbing pulse
Of Aching Space,
In the eons between
I piled upon you
Pain on pain
Ache on ache
And yet as I go
I shall know
That you will grieve
And want me back..... 

To Bennetti 

You have freed me—
In opening wide the doors
Of fiesh—
You have freed me
Of the binding leash.
I have climbed the heights
Of white disaster.
My body screaming
In the silver crash of passion.....
Before you gave yourself
To him
I had chained myself
For you.
But when at last
You lowered your proud flag
In surrender complete
You gave me too, as hostage—
And I have swept my joy
At the dawn-tipped shrine
Of many breasts. 

To Jean

When you poured your love
Like molten flame
Into the throbbing mold
Of her pulsing veins
Leaving her blood a river of fire
And her arteries channels of light,
I hated you... 
Hated with that primal hate
That has its wells
In the flesh of me
And the flesh of you
And the flesh of her
I hated you—
Hated with envy
Your mastery of her being. .
With one fleshy gesture
You pricked the irridescent bubble
Of my dreams
And so to make
Your conquest more sweet
I tell you now
That I hated you...

To Catalina

Love thy piano,Oh girl,
It will give you back
Note for Note
The harmonies of your soul.
It will sing back to you
The high songs of your heart.
It will give
As well as take.

To Mariette

I sought ccnsolation
In the sorrow of your eyes.
You sought reguerdon
In the crying of my heart. .
We found that shattered dreamers
Can be bitter hosts.... 

To ———— 

You call it
Death of the Spirit
And I call it Life...
The vigor of vibration,
The muffled knocks,
The silver sheen of passion’s flood,
The ecstacy of pain..
You call it
Death of the Spirit
And I call it Life.

To Telie

You have made my voice
A rippling laugh
But my heart
A crying thing .
’Tis better thus,
A fleeting kiss
And then,
The dark

To “Chick”

Oh Achilles of the moleskins
And the gridiron
Do not wonder
Nor doubt that this is I
That lie so calmly here—
This is the same exultant beast
That so joyously
Ran the ball with you
In those far flung days of abandon.
You remember how récklessly
We revelled in the heat and the dust
And the swirl of conflict?
You remember they called us
The Terrible Two?
And you remember
After we had battered our heads
And our bodies
Against the stonewall of their defense,—
You remember the signal
I would call
And how you would look at me
In faith and admiration
And say “Let’s go”...
How the lines would clash
And strain,
And how I would find an opening,
A wee small space,
Amidst tangling arms and torsos,
And how I would slip through
Fighting and squirming
Over the line
To victory.
You remember, Chick?
When you gaze at me here
Let that same light
Of faith and admiration
Shine in your eyes
For I have battered the stark stonewall
Before me. 
I have kept faith with you
And now
I have called my signal,
Found my opening
And slipped through
Fighting and squirming
Over the line
To victory.

To Wanda

To you, so far away
So cold and aloof, -
To you, who knew me so well,
This is my last Grand Gesture
This my last Great Effect
And as I go winging
Through the black doors of eternity
Is that thin sound I hear
Your applause? .....

And such a crowd!
It is neither black nor white,
Brown nor yellow There are all colors,
There are all manners of peopleI
Here and there, you may catch
Blue-tinted by the smoke
A glimpse of an oriental face
The lights of the place are as manv-hued
As the faces of the people
Wine and Whiskey are poured like oil
Into the fire of Youth,
Causing leaping, ambitious flames
Giving added brightness to maiden eves
Which seem to say, ""There is fire within, Beware!"" -
Old men and women are here, too
Their glimmering coals are fanned to heat anew
Soul endangering,
Which consume their dry old carcasses.
There comes a whirl of noise
Like the breaking of a storm.
There is a hint of harmony--
A bit of melody.
Five men, black, brown and yellow
Contortionists of notes, instruments
And bodies, make music.
At once, there is wild motion!
Motion that defies description
Each couple improvising movements.
Those most inflamed by wine, music
Or close embraces,
Surpass their fellows.
My eyes follow couple after couple.
There is a brown girl, a wild thing,
Graceful as rippling silk,
With eyes that laugh over the shoulders of a
Bold boy
Whose ancestors might have been Vikings,
So big and strong is he.
They whirl on and I lose them in the crowd,
Only to be attracted by a Chinese lad
Dancing gaily with a maiden of the Occident.
He holds her closely-- His face expressionless.
The girl is smiling
No, she is Iaughing!
He whispers something with a swift side-wise glance.
She tosses back her pretty head
And laughs and laughs and laughs!
A little brown haired girl
With a Lothario long withered
Who would cheat Time with such a play-mate
Flirts boldly with a brown youngster.
Who has the look of neither toiling
Nor spinning,
He is good-looking, I think
Yet, too smooth-looking, too finished in
His knife-creased clothes.
He hints of marked cards--bounty paving women--
Yet-Satyrs grown gross pouched and bald
Are damn poor jazzing mates!

Which whistled through the lurid jungle morn,
Which moaned among the hills their eerie strains

Strong winds which bore my fathers’ battle-cries,
Which roused their hearts to love, or calmed to peace ;— 
They call me! and within my spirit rise
Fierce yearnings aye, that cannot, will not cease!
And over countless leagues of swirling sea,
Through all the years, I've heard their wild refrain,
I’ve known the joy of their weird melody,
The fierce, ecstatic tumult of their pain!
And long as those impetuous winds shall blow,
Though paler men may never feel their surge,
My songs will bear their burthen! I shall know
Their fervent, fiery passion and their urge!

Trading in human flesh for private gain;
He heard the moans of slvaes to heaven ascend
   And saw men prostrate, wreathed in grime and mud;
   It made the Moon in agony wring blood
And caused his heart to melt, his breast to rend.
He wept to see the country that he loved
   Cursed with disease, slow-dying at the core,

And his revolting soul with ,pity moved.

A gallant West-Pointer--no idle pretender.

We cover our Colonel with flags and with flowers
   And lay him to rest where his comrades are lain;
His sculptured memorial in Arlington towers,

The surging, racial currents force the stream
Whose grappling groundswells shake the solid main
Within the gaze of star and sunlight gleam
With prayers and moans their mingled accents rise
From shoal and reef, from harbor, bar and bay;
They rush the surfs to gain some glittering prize
Till in the misty void they melt away,
Like vapors rising from a boiling sea
Into the ocean of eternity.

Peace ,Georgia Douglas Johnson,Johnson,"I rest me deep within the wood,
   Drawn by its silent call,
Far from the throbbing crowd of men
   On nature's breast I fall.

 
My couch is sweet with blossoms fair,
   A bed of fragrant dreams,
And soft upon my ear there falls
   The lullaby of streams.

 
The tumult of my heart is stilled,
   Within this sheltered spot.
Deep in the bosom of the wood.

Was regal and was impotent,

Now by reflection's placid pool,

For every glancing, golden gleam,

Rainy Season Love Song,Gladys May Casey Hayford,Casely-Hayford,"Out of the tense awed darkness, my Frangepani
       comes;
Whilst the blades of Heaven flash round her, and
       the roll of thunder drums,
My young heart leaps and dances, with exquisite
       joy and pain,
As storms within and storms without I meet my
       love in the rain.
“The rain is in love with you darling; it’s kissing
       you everywhere,
Rain pattering over your small brown feet, rain
       in your curly hair;
Rain in the vale that your twin breasts make, as
       in delicate mounds they rise,
I hope there is rain in your heart, Frangepani, as
        rain half fills your eyes.”
Into my hands she cometh, and the lightning of my
       desire
Flashes and leaps about her, more subtle than
       Heaven's fire;
“The lightning’s in love with you darling; it is
       loving you so much,
That its warm electricity in you pulses wherever
       I may touch.
When I kiss your lips and your eyes, and your
       hands like twin flowers apart,
I know there is lightning Frangepani, deep in the
       depths of your heart.”
The thunder rumbles about us, and I feel its tri-
       umphant note
As your warm arms steal around me; and I kiss
       your dusky throat;
“The thunder'’s in love with you darling. It hides
       its power in your breast.
And I feel it stealing o'er me as I lie in your arms
       at rest.
I sometimes wonder, beloved, when I drink from
       life’s proffered bowl,
Whether there's thunder hidden in the innermost
       parts of your soul.”
Out of my arms she stealeth; and I am left alone
       with the night,
Void of all sounds save peace, the first faint glim-
       mer of light.
Into the quiet, hushed stillness my Frangepani goes.
Is there peace within like the peace without? Only

The Memory of Colonel Charles Denton Young,Harriette Shadow Butcher,Butcher,"With satin skin and body bare, they beat the air with drum;
They sang a weird, uncanny song that seemed to strike them numb;
Full passionate their bodies beat to time not elsewhere heard—
A melody of wind and rain and gentle song of bird.

   When hawk and eagle fly by night,
   There shines on each the same moon’s light.

With satin skin and body bare they danced to sun and star,
They stalked the mighty game to lair, and drew men near and far;
With milky skin and body decked a people came to see
What made the satin bare-skinned men so happy and so free.

   When hawk and eagle search by day,
   They seek, forsooth, the self-same prey.

The simple truth they failed to see, it lay before their eyes:
The men with satin skins were kings; they wore no motley dyes;
They reached their goal on sweeping wings—such wings as eagles fly.
The nightingale no longer sings when hawks go sailing by.

   O eagle, spread your wings tonight;
   Let not the hawk get out of sight.

The milky skins took bodies bare across the ocean wide;
They made them slaves to their command, their souls they could not guide.
All day the slaves worked in the sun, to till the soil their task,
They suffered all that humans could and wore a smiling mask.

   The eagle soars high in the air;
   It holds a place no hawk will dare.

With nothing they could call their own, no earthly prize to win,
Their hidden souls were theirs alone,—a holiness within;
They held their heads as eagles do and looked into the sky.
The hawks made circles in the air and with great pride flew by.

   O hawk, fold up your wings tonight.
   The eagle’s flown far from your sight.

Crusader, you of our own time, who proved to all the world
That red and blue and white are strong when in ene emblem furled;
Crusader, true, of our own time, who left a country fair,
You turned a Son to your own clime—a Son with kingly air.
For, radiant in your consciousness beneath your carriage bold,
There shone your heritage of strength—a gift that eagles hold.

There will be a glorious sunset:
  ""Peace must always follow strife.""
When the Master sendeth sorrow,
   In his own time he'll bring joy;
Only wait the lovely morrow:
   ""Gold's too soft without alloy.""
When we frown o'er rainy weather,
   Roaring winds and winter's shrouds,
List! and hear the bright side whisper:
   ""There's a rainbow in the clouds.""
Cease from looking on the dark side;
   Look around, behold the bright,
And will find how many blessings
   Have been hidden from our sight.
Neither sorrowing nor complaining,
   Only wait the Master's will;
Hear his loving message saying:
   ""Only trust, I'm with you still.""
Lead us, Father, guide, protect us,
   As through life we blindly roam;
May we find, when toil is o'er,
Rest at last in Heaven -- our Home. ",January,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,female,,,Boston,Predom. Black,
Sonnet to a Negro in Harlem,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"You are disdainful and magnificent-
Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
Small wonder that you are incompetent
To imitate those whom you so despise
Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
Let others toil and sweat for labor's sake
And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.

Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.

To ramble in the twilight after supper,
And to count the pretty faces that you meet.

With joy and hurry and laughter and push and sweat —
Squeezed next a patent-leathered Negro dreaming
Of a wrinkled river and a minnow net.

And read of kings and queens in foreign lands,
Hyperbole of romance and adventure,
All for a penny the color of my hand.

And hushed before the silent prayer it breathes,
To melt the still snow with my seething body
And kiss the warm earth tremulous underneath.

Bottled,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"Upstairs on the third floor
Of the 135th Street library
In Harlem, I saw a little
Bottle of sand, brown sand
Just like the kids make pies
Out of down at the beach.
But the label said: “This
Sand was taken from the Sahara desert.”
Imagine that! The Sahara desert!
Some bozo's been all the way to Africa to get some sand.
And yesterday on Seventh Avenue
I saw a darky dressed fit to kill
In yellow gloves and swallow tail coat
And swirling a cane. And everyone
Was laughing at him. Me too,
At first, till I saw his face
When he stopped to hear a
Organ grinder grind out some jazz.
Boy! You should a seen that darky's face!
It just shone. Gee, he was happy!
And he began to dance. No
Charleston or Black Bottom for him.
No sir. He danced just as dignified
And slow. No, not slow either.
Dignified and proud! You couldn't
Call it slow, not with all the
Cuttin' up he did. You would a died to see him.
The crowd kept yellin' but he didn't hear,
Just kept on dancin' and twirlin' that cane
And yellin' out loud every once in a while.
I know the crowd thought he was coo-coo.
But say, I was where I could see his face,
And somehow, I could see him dancin' in a jungle,
A real honest-to-cripe jungle, and he wouldn't have on them
Trick clothes—those yaller shoes and yaller gloves
And swallow-tail coat. He wouldn't have on nothing.
And he wouldn't be carrying no cane.
He'd be carrying a spear with a sharp fine point
Like the bayonets we had “over there.""
And the end of it would be dipped in some kind of
Hoo-doo poison. And he'd be dancin' black and naked and gleaming.
And he'd have rings in his ears and on his nose
And bracelets and necklaces of elephants' teeth.
Gee, I bet he'd be beautiful then all right.
No one would laugh at him then, I bet.
Say! That man that took that sand from the Sahara desert
And put it in a little bottle on a shelf in the library,
That's what they done to this shine, ain't it? Bottled him.

The Door ,Henry Davis Middleton,Middleton,"Despair and darkness veils the rugged way
   That winds o'er crag and barren plain and moor,
Where plods the fearless freedman day by day,
   Up to the open door.

Through the wide portals beacons break the gloom
   Now shadows flee, the night is almost o'er
And in the gloaming dusky freedom loom
   With faith, simple and pure.

O, cruel fate that beckons and betrays,
   'That shatters hope and fair forebodings dim,
All, all seems lost, labor of nights and days,
   The door is barred to him.

Exile or alien from far distant shores,
   Find a warm welcome wait their wiles or wares,
While noble natives languish at the doors,
   Denied their honest shares.

Relent, arrogant censors, heed his call,
   Nor mock his pains nor mimic his sad plight,
Your fate is tempted by his rise or fall
   Rather than by your might.

Let then the portals open full and free,
   The lustrous light its obscure threshold bare,
Merit alone should be the master key,
   Let all the worthy share. ",May,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,male,"Racism, Slavery",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,
The Persecuted,Henry Lee Moon,Moon,"The persecuted make obeisance to many gods,
Many unanswering gods—
Gods who turn deaf ears
To the prayers of the earth’s disinherited,
Who hear not the mumbled plaints of voiceless pariahs 
Abased at the feet of the gods of their despoilers.

Not for dumb driven diggers of ditches,
Not for dust-choked pickers of cotton,
Nor straining loaders of carriers,
Not for the fettered multitudes
That worship at their shrines
Do the gods perform their miracles.

Seeking balms for their sores
The persecuted receive but the sting of irritants;
Seeking contentment, but the bitterness of denial.
With wounds recrudescent,
With minds uncontent
They turn yet
To the gods of the privileged.

And the gods?
In their cloistered sanctuaries
The worshipped stare with poker faces
At the antics of the dust.

The gods of the persecuted are many
But unanswering.

The Black Man's Burden,Hubert Harrison,Harrison,"Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Send forth the worst ye breed,
And bind our sons in shackles
To serve your selfish greed.

To wait in heavy harness,
Be-deviled and beguiled
Until the Fates Remove you
From a world you have defiled.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Your lies may still abide
To veil the threat of terror,
And check our racial pride;

Your cannon, church and courthouse
May still our sons constrain
To seek the white man’s profit
And work the white man’s gain.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Reach out and hog the earth,
And leave your workers hungry
In the country of their birth.

Then, when your goal is nearest,
The end for which you fought,
Watch Teuton trained efficiency
Bring all your hope for nought.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Reduce their chiefs and kings
To toil of serf and sweeper,
The lot of common things.

Sodden their soil with slaughter
Ravish their lands with lead;
Go, sign them with your living
And seal them with your dead.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
And keep your old reward;
The curse of those ye cozen,
The hate of those ye barred

From your Canadian cities
And your Australian ports;
And when they ask for meat and drink,
Go, girdle them with forts.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Ye cannot stoop to less.
Will not your fraud of freedom
Still cloak your greediness?

But, by the gods ye worship,
And by the deeds ye do,
These silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Until the tale is told,
Until the balances of hate
Bear down the beam of gold.

And while ye wait, remember
That Justice, though delayed,
Will hold you as her debtor, till
The Black Man’s debt is paid.",December ,1915,Colored American Review,R.G. Doggett,,male,"Intertext, Empire",,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Harrison
Thirteen Black Martyrs of Houston,I.C. B.,B.,"I stand in awe and . . .
Bow my head in shame

Free, nntrampled justice
And Christian Rule —so called—
Lynching still holds sway!

Oh, ye ! whose blood has . . .
Not turned yellow, but —
Still runs crimson, as in
Mother's sacred womb,
Can ye, with inborn conscience
Give ""unwritten"" Lynch Law— room?

I dare say: ""No!""
No self-respecting mortal
Who loves humanity and
Submits to white man's ""written"" laws.
Condones such jackal, cut-throat practice,
That chokes great Lincoln's aim with . . .
""Hyena Claws!""

Yet, notwithstanding all,
Our black boys fought like heroes
To save this white man's country
From an unknown foreign foe.
Their noble deeds were heralded by allies
In France, in Belgium and in England too.

The beaten foe himself,
Feels conscience-bound to honor
The black man's valor and his daring deeds ;
But Southland . . . Home !—with Houston —
   Texas leading.
Insults parading heroes on return; Oh, Shame!

What then? Some heart-sick boys resented
The unjust treatment meted out to them.
When quickly organized a rabble, ready
For record-breaking savage cruelty,
And hanged the boys that risked their lives for them.

And heart fear-stricken, on the motley horde
Of Turks now gathered in with feverish haste
To meet the dread, on-coming Bulgar host.
Truly he spake, for scarce the foes had met
When the wild flight began, the vengeful sword
Of the Bulgarian taking fearful toll
As fleeing thousands fall to rise no more.
Surely the years bring on the fatal day
To that dark land, from whose unhallowed ground
The blood of countless innocents so long
Has cried to God, nor longer cries in vain. 
But not alone by war a nation falls.
Tho' she be fair, serene as radiant morn,
Tho' girt by seas, secure in armament,
Let her but spurn the Vision of the Cross;
Tread with contemptuous feet on its command
Of Mercy, Love and Human Brotherhood,
And she, some fateful day, shall have no need
Of enemy to bring her to the dust.
Some day, tho' distant it may be—with God
A thousand years are but as yesterday—
The germs of hate, injustice, violence,
Like an insidious canker in the blood,
Shall eat the nation's vitals. She shall see
Break forth the blood-red tide of anarchy,
Sweeping her plains, laying her cities low,
And bearing on its seething, crimson flood
The wreck of government, of home, and all
The nation's pride, its splendor and its power;
On, with relentless flow, into the sea
Of God's eternal vengeance wide and deep,
But for God's grace! Oh, may it hold thee fast,
My Country, until justice shall prevail
O'er wrong and o'er oppression's cruel power,
And all that makes humanity to mourn.

The Snapping of the Bow,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I dreamed a dream, and, in my dream, I heard
One wail at midnight by a convent's walls.
And, as he wailed, he clutched the stars, and shook
The pillars of the firmament of God,
And rolled the thunders of Olympus down
On men; and they besought their holy ones
To plead with him ---lest he might spoil the world.

   His face was bronze; his limbs were bronze but steel;
His mane was blacker than the Steeds of Night.
And his great eyes flashed warnings from beneath
A citadel where daring thoughts abode.
A comely youth---why needed he to weep?

     Alas! upon his brow he wore the brand
Of degradation, and upon his neck
A circlet galling as a crime!--And from
The cursed thing a chain of hate e'er bound
Him where he stood. His hands were manacled;
His limbs wore thongs that cut the flesh agape,
Until, for the pure pain, he writhed and wept,---
As weeps a conquered god-the prisoner of Despair!
He flung himself upon his knees, and burst into a prayer:

      ""O God, and hast
Thou made me for these miseries? I feel
Myself a man ---I have the spirit and
The hopes of one. O, why, then, must I strive
And fail?---No lake is clearer than my soul;
No ship is prouder; none more tempest tost.
'Tis true my brow is dark; but, in the night,
My spirit walks the stars, and lightly spurns.
Its kinship to this world!---Lord, I have tried;
The burden of the failure rests with thee.""
So fell he tranced.

      But, on the plain there rose
A phantom of the silent sphinx---the grim,
Spell-casting thought of some deep master dead.
And lo! beside its ancient, crumbling base,
Napoleon, fresh from mighty deeds of war,
Halted his band, and spoke in tones of awe.—
All this I saw, and dreamed that yet---aye, yet!—
The race might rise that built the awful thing
That holds its secret still in Egypt's sands.",May,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,Slavery,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Corrothers
To --------- (A Sonnet),James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Beyond the hilltops to the north and west.
   Beyond the dells, and past the pleasant streams.
   Beyond the lakes that murmur in their dreams
The liquid fancies of their silver rest-―-
In such sweet thoughts as haunt a poet's breast--
   (For lakes are poets, Love) there dwells my theme's
   Sweet idol, you, Beloved , O Love, it seems
That of all women you are first and best!
   I love you deeply, and my soul would prove
Its passion. Dearest, on this page for you.
What shall I say ?—O Love, believe me true!

         My soul's blown odors , if they know my love. ",November,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,Sonnet,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Corrothers
Years That Are To Come,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Stream of Time, each wavelet year
   Shall lose its own in thee,
From source unknown to disappear
   In vales of mystery.
Though vast and deep they move along ,
   Thy waters be not glum ;
For, list ! they chant a murmured song
   Of years that are to come.

O years that are to come, I know
   Not what ye hide from me,
In thy dark waters, as they flow
   Into eternity;
What joy commingles with the tears.
   That fleck thy veiling foam ,
O far, dim, mystic , silent years
   Long years which are to come.

O years, the years that passed, we may
   Behold them wind along
Thro ' Memory's pleasant , shady way ,
   And list their low, sweet song;
But ye, still years , so gently steal
   Us hence and bear us home,
We scarce the languid current feel,
   O years that are to come.

Majestic river, deep in thee
   Embosomed secrets hide ,
That ne'er shall reach humanity –
   Save with thy moving tide.
The magic of their beauty shall
   Make poets of the dumb
When faltered songs, like mine, must fail
   In years that are to come.

How sweet thy mellow song shall be,
   When thou hast lulled asleep
The discords of humanity
   That make thee sob and weep .
The music of thy moving then
   Will thrill the hearts of some;
For Peace shall walk the earth again,
   In years that are to come.

O vestal waters robed in haze!
   O mirrored, tranquil tide!
On thy enchanted course I gaze,
   As on thy ripples glide;
Tho ' in the dark depth pictures gleam ,
   I hear a voice speak low:
""You dream, but, ah ! were Life a dream,
   Time's waters would not flow.""

Flow, O thou stream incessant flow .
   Nor reck ' if in thy wave
The leaves of sorrow fall like snow ,
   And storms around may rave .
The storms that fret thy bosom wide
   Must in the distance cease ;
And leaves in thy resistless tide
   Shall be submerged in peace.

O years that still shall roll along,
   When I am silent clay,
If, 'chance, ye find this faltering song,
   Do with it as ye may;.
But, sweetly as the morning bright
   Dispels the shrouding gloom,
Turn thy dark features to the light,
   O years that are to come.",January,1905,Colored American,Fred R. Moore,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Corrothers

The Gift of the Greatest God,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"It was in the magic city, in Apollo's temple there,—
'Mid scenes of brilliant splendor , and enchanting beauty rare;
'Mid domes and spires and minarets ; lakes, groves, and flowers and streams ,
And music sweet as singing in the City of Our Dreams!
Thus set, Apollo's temple stood , as fair to mortal eyes
As the palace of Aladdin in a land of paradise!
And in its walls the president a levee held that day,
To greet a grateful people o'er whose hearts his love held sway.

Crowned by the law's majestic power , and guarded by its might ,
The president stood smiling on the people , left and right ;
And giving, with a stately grace, a friendly clasp of hand
To any who might reach him -tho ' the humblest in the land .
To a mighty organ's pealings , the procession moved along—
Merchant and sturdy toiler mingling in the countless throng ;
Proud dames and merry working girls- high, low; the young and fair
The black and white , and many born in other lands were there .

But, look you! Yonder comes Czolgosz, the strippling , with bound hand ,
To strike , with serpent's venom, the chief ruler of the land!
He has planned the deed with cunning , and will execute it soon----
Write, with inky black of Hades, “Murder "" on the sky of noon!
He would bathe the thrones of earth in blood -abolish law and love ;
Thwart commerce ; ruin church and home-tear God from Heaven above ;
Give lust free rein and crime a throne -set shame and terror free,
And light, with burning homes , the mad, red hell of Anarchy !

The president had stopped to kiss a pretty little child ,
And pat its head ; then on the throng again he looked and smiled ;
Now came the baby's mother ; next , Parker, the Negro , there ;-
And when Czolgosz , and---two quick shots rang sharply on the air.
You know the story: How the wounded president sank down ;
And how brave Parker leaped and bore the assassin to the ground .
I read it all, and, tho ' my tears fell ere I ceased to read,
My heart beat higher as it told of Parker's noble deed!

That night I dreamed the scene again : Anon methought a change
Transfigured all ---The moonlight filled the room with beauty strange ,
While ,thro ' an open doorway , surged the people ,wave on wave ,
To greet the ebon hero who had done a deed so brave .
From every section of the land the grateful people came
To load this mighty Son of Ham with trophies of his fame .
And from far distant countries, in my dream it seemed to me,
Came king and czar and emperor this fearless man to see .

This was not all : Methought the shades of the immortal dead
In shadow forms , moved softly with the concourse , haply led
By pity for the struggling Race of Man to lend their aid.
In this dread hour . They came in robes of light and mist arrayed :
There Moses , Plato , Shakespeare, Burns, John Brown and Douglass stood,
August of mien , and grand of brow, in beauteous brotherhood ,-
Some with the light of ages garlanded, but all aglow
With holy glory , looming grand and god -like here below .

""What shall we give this Negro,"" cried the populace , as one-
""How fittingly reward him for the deed that he hath done ? ""
Answered Kaiser William quickly , "" In the Rhine -land , such as he
Are knighted ; honored ; landed ; loved and feted royally !""
Quoth Edward-—“ In old England , wrong is wrong and right is right ;
And, were he there, we'd treat him like a Briton- black or white!""
Then the Czar said : “To my Russia let this noble black be sent ,
Where to Pouskin, our black poet, we have reared a monument .""

Then Douglass said to Plato : ""What said I of my race?
Said I not the world judged wrongly, when it judged by hue of face ?
Aye ! there are more noble in my race than there 'er were knaves or brutes ,
And they, like trees uncultured , may not yield their choicest fruits .""
""Thou 't right,"" said Plato, nobly ; ""he hath proved himself a man!----
Diogenes would name him so, could he his features scan .""
And Moses said : ""Amen! Amen!---I am made only men,
As Burns hath sung ."" And John Brown said : ""I'd die for such again!""

""What shall thy gift be, Parker?"" asked a man with blanching cheek .
A Negro mother with her babe cried : ""Speak ! In God's name , speak !""
Then Parker said : “O, hear me ! This is my request I make ;
And grant it, not for me alone ; but for my people's sake .
Set us free to go as workers in the wide fields of the Lord !
We ask no special favors ; labor brings its own reward !
Strike the social chains from off us ; let us be as men 'mongst men—
And we'll do you deeds as noble as are writ with human pen!

""We do not ask for seats around the white man's fireside ,
But for opportunities to work in fields to us denied—
A chance to toil with willing hands at work God made us for,
And not to do that which we hate, with self and God at war !
We want to live as free men ; not as half slaves 'mong the free,
With free men's rights and homes in this fair Land of Liberty !
'Tis not to enter white men's homes, but to enjoy our own
In the land for which our fathers died-the only we have known!”

A consternation fell upon the throng , both young and old ,
As Parker's voice rang thro ' the hall in accents loud and bold .
And 't was declared impossible to grant request so rash .
""You tried to save our Chief, "" one said. ""What will you take in cash?""
But Parker said : ""Can it not be?"" And Plato cried , ""For shame!""
And Moses rent his robes , and wailed : "" It offendeth God's high name!""
And Douglass wept, and John Brown's face grew stern, as wroth with man,
As he heard his people cry : ""Alas ! we can't; and who - who can?”

But , at that moment, in the door , a wondrous form appeared ,
And , as he clove the parting throng , the Immortals softly cheered .
""It is the dauntless future,"" Plato cried , ""the Mightiest!---
Who loveth mortals , and is , of Immortals , first and best !""
The future stood majestic . Calm his brow was ; in his speech
The awe and music of the waves that kiss the pebbly beach ;
His face leonine , but fair ; and he spake , as the room grew still ,
""Tho ' ye think ye may not do so much, I can, I swear , and---will!""",December,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,Patriotism,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Corrothers
The Road to the Bow,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Ever and ever and anon,
After the black storm, the eternal, beautous bow!
Brother, to rosy-painted mists that arch beyond,
Blithely I go.

My brown men laurled and my lyre
Twined with immortal ivy for one little rippling song;
My “House of Golden Leaves” they praised and “passionate fire”--
But, friend, the way is long!

Onward and onward, up! away!
Though Fear all his banners in my face,
And my feet stumble, lo! The Orphean day!
Forward by God’s grace!

These signs are still before me: “Fear”
“Danger”, “Unprecedented” and I hear black “No”
Still thundering and “Churl.” Good Friend,
I rest me here–
Then to the glittering bow!

Loometh and cometh Hate in wrath,
Mailed Wrong, swart Servitutde and Shame, with bitter rue,
Nathless a Negro poet’s feet must tread the path 
The winged god knew.

Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I
Forefend the anathema, following the span.
I hold my head as proudly high 
As any man.

In the Matter of Two Men,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"One does such work as one will not,
  And well each knows the right;
Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,
  The black must serve the white.
And it's, oh, for the white man's softening flesh,
  While the black man's muscles grow!
Well I know which grows the mightier,
  I know; full well I know.
The white man seeks the soft, fat place,
  And he moves and he works by rule.
Ingenious grows the humbler race
  In Oppression's prodding school.
And it's, oh, for a white man gone to seed,
  While the Negro struggles so!
And I know which race develops most,
  I know; yes, well I know.
The white man rides in a palace car,
  And the Negro rides ""Jim Crow.""
To damn the other with bolt and bar,
  One creepeth so low; so low!
And it's, oh, for a master's nose in the mire,
  While the humbled hearts o'erflow!
Well I know whose soul grows big at this,
  And whose grows small; I know!
The white man leases out his land,
  And the Negro tills the same.
One works; one loafs and takes command;
  But I know who wins the game!
And it's, oh, for the white man's shrinking soil,
  As the black's rich acres grow!
Well I know how the signs point out at last,
  I know; ah, well I know!
The white man votes for his color's sake,
  While the black, for his is barred;
(Though ""ignorance"" is the charge they make),
  But the black man studies hard.
And it's, oh, for the white man's sad neglect,
  For the power of his light let go!
So, I know which man must win at last,

"Listen, O Isles!",James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"LISTEN, O ISLES!* 
[An appreciation of the Philippine Constabulary Band, organized by a Negro, Captain Loving, through the suggestion of former President Taft.] 

 I. 
Swirled over-most by Titan winds that toss
Their limbs and ringlets in the eddying air.
Like death-loosed poets, with their breeze-blown hair,
Hymning to mountains, precipice and palm,
Or sighing soft as Seraph's evening psalm—
Startled by storm burst; stilled in love's deep loss,
Listen, O Dream Isles of the Orient Main,
Thy brown elves wake and pour lost Eden's choral strain! 

II.
Thrilled by brown magi from the nymphean coves.
Old nations sing as if the centuries
Sighed to the stars some old, lost planet's love;
Now Egypt breathes: now Babylon, Persia, Greece,
Through these soft pipes, wake, sighing, like the groves
Where gods have wandered, and where winds are whispering ""Peace.""
But hear the flute's sweet eccentricities
'Neath the white moon, you castled stream above,
Till crash of cymbals, turban'd Turks have known,
And sound's fine rain, and booming of deep drums,
(And the brown gnome who pursueth wind gusts through
Old Triton's wreathed shell, he wakes anew—
Bellowing, like Neptune's rage, with much ado),
Drown, with their ocean roar, the little bird
Whose notes, like dainty Ariel's, laughed that they were heard.
Was it Adonis, wandering alone,
Waked, with sweet lips, the silver piccolo,
Fair Music's nightingale, which sang: ""Mine own,
Mine own, dear Love, dost thou not know; not know?""
Now, o'er the hills, is it Apollo comes,
Pouring (oh, hear!) sound's golden honey down could drown
Those silver reeds whose notes go down to some
Well's bottom, over crystal rocks?Oh, come!
Hear music ripple, like a breeze that's blown
O'er ripening fields and Daphne's rosy vale,
Full, deep and resonant! Hear this rose gale
Of June's sweet Calliope wake, and all
The muses rouse from dreamy murmurings!
Hear shout and revel; romp and tipsy call
Of woodland fairies. List! What siren sings
O'er ocean voicings— deep, divinely deep!
What billowed tempests rage; what surge and sweep;
What equal thunderings storm Poseidon's throne,
And sound Earth's black abyss! Now Ares fires
The clouds, and far his awful symphony fills
The world. 'Tis war! Embattled Harmony Sends
Echo flying, golden, to the hills,
To win brave heights where the winged eagle tires.
And oh! the battle music rageth gloriously!
Till, victory won, a last loud bar begins
With roll of kettledrums, like boom of bees that drone,
On heavy wings, down sultry summer winds,
And unmolested bays where love sees one white sail. 

III.

And what of him who leads these happy fauns?
This Afric' Pan who broke the crystal lip
Of Sound's lost river; plashed there, and let drip
Thy soul, O Islands, mystical and sweet,
Through reeds that bowed and nodded at Taft's feet,
Fair and unbroken, 'mid the clamorous
Dawn's Cry and appealings? Courage, O my race! 
Courage and patience, Islands; ye shall yet have place!

At the Closed Gate of Justice,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"To be a Negro in a day like this
  Demands forgiveness. Bruised with blow on blow,
Betrayed, like him whose woe dimmed eyes gave bliss
  Still must one succor those who brought one low,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this
  Demands rare patience--patience that can wait
In utter darkness. 'Tis the path to miss,
  And knock, unheeded, at an iron gate,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this
  Demands strange loyalty. We serve a flag
Which is to us white freedom's emphasis.
  Ah! one must love when Truth and Justice lag,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this--
  Alas! Lord God, what evil have we done?
Still shines the gate, all gold and amethyst,
  But I pass by, the glorious goal unwon,
""Merely a Negro""--in a day like this!

A Song of May and June,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Oh sweet, as an orient 'Maid o' the moon,'
   With wild roses in her dark hair,
Entranced by the magical minstrel June,
   May stands in her garden fair.

For June, the herald of summer gay,
   Is prince of its minstrelsy;
And never a monarch of ancient day
   Wore gaudier robes than he.
Over the hills comes the minstrel June,

Sweet may will sink on his breast a-swoon, 
   And die as he holds her there.

Tribute to Paul Laurence Dunbar,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"There came a dark youth singing in the dawn
Of a new freedom, to a mellow lyre,
Refining, as with touch of an Apollo's fire,
The songs a lowly people sang upon
A toilsome way. The night of gloom was gone;
He stood, full-throated, cheering son and sire
To garner grain, despising rain and mire
Of yesternight. ""To-day,"" he sang, ""toil on
And up, my race, from vale toward glory's crest!""
Men marvelled at the singer, strong and sweet.
He left the forest, drenched with storms of night,
And faced the morning, beautiful with light,
To die while shadows still fell toward the west,
And leave his laurels at a people's feet.",March,1906,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,"Intertext, Paul Laurence Dunbar",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/james-d-corrothers-author-page
The Peace of God ,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I.
I sat at eve, as the sun sunk low,
And the shadows grew, and the dark came down,
Where the sea moved restlessly to and fro,
At the foot of a dreamy, old, picturesque town,
And I listened and dreamt to the sea's mournful sound,
And my heart beat heavy and sad and slow
As the waves that moaned on the sands below,
While the ships went by, and the night fell 'round.

II.
And I thought of the friendships that faded away,
And the lost hopes that left me so sad and alone;
Ambitions that towered and fell to decay;
And many a loved one, long silent and gone,-
Dear virtues, as pure as the clouds that looked down,
So, white, o'er that dreamy, old, picturesque town;-
And my heart beat heavy and sad and slow,
As I turned the dim leaves of the dear long ago,
And watched the ships pass, as the night fell 'round.

III.
And I thought, as the ghoulish dark crept o'er the land,
Of a sweet, dreamy face, like the meadows in May;
And the soft, thrilling touch of a pretty, brown hand;
And a love that died as the beautiful day
Had perished that night, in that heedless old town, -
With its spires all white, and its hills all brown;-
But my dream died, too, in its bed of woe,
And the waves made its dirge on the sands below,
While the weird shadows strove with the darkness all 'round.

IV.
The stars came silently out up above,
To watch o'er the grave of the beautiful day;
And the moon, a proud creature, too cold for our love,
Came, veiling her face, in a mystical way;
And, roaming the still sky, looked wondering down
On me—and that dreamy, old slumbering town,
And my heart's blood froze, as I sat there alone,
And heard the waves chanting their requiem-like tone,
While the dim ships, like phantoms, went past on the sound.

V.
I sat there, and looked at night's banner unfurled,
With all its rich beauties and wonders so rare;
And I thought that each star was a happier world,
And confess that I longed, like a child, to be there,
Where the holy ones pity us, as they look down
On our Earth, with her many a sin-blinded town,
And hearts that beat heavy and sad and slow,
'Till they break and fail, and unheeded go,
While the world moves on in the same old round.

VI. 
Then I railed against Christ, as I sat there alone,
For blinding the world with His weak fairy tale;
And I wondered why God, on His thunder-girt throne,
Allowed useful lives and their strivings to fail;-
And I told the great God to His teeth that He lied!
That they who best served Him mankind crucified-
And weary and heart-sore and crazed with despair
I paced the bleak seashore, and muttered a prayer
To the winds!—but it died in the chill evening air.

VII.
Away in the midnight, I made me a prayer,
And sent it to God, on His beautiful throne, -
The calm moonlight slept in the deep, silver air;
But the moon glittered coldly and proudly alone,
And the stars, twinkling high in the blue sky, looked down
Like pitying eyes o'er that desolate town,--
When my prayer came back, on its pinions of snow,
That beat the still air into music below,
And my soul was amazed at the peace it had found.

VIII.
Then I spake to the Lord, as I journeyed along,
""Dear God, Thou hast sent me a blessing in tears;
I only can give Thee the poor, broken song
Of a soul that hath found Thee thro' doubts and thro' fears;
But, break my heart, Lord, and, if balm Thou should'st find,
Give it, in mercy, to erring mankind.""
And I heard the low words, as they issued in air,
Borne off on the wings of my hovering prayer,
And the night grew glad with its lingering there. ",June,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,Religion,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/james-d-corrothers-author-page
In a Southland Vale ,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Down in the Southland once I found a vale
   Wherein I thought the fairy muses dreamed.
   Thither so oft I went that soon it seemed
My soul, when lonely, sought that quiet dale.
So I would go; and, when all else would fail,
   Peace met me there, with gentle eyes that streamed
   In sympathy; and Hope came; and I deemed
That, sheltered safe from every stormy gale,
   Dreaming sweet dreams, 'twere sweet to rest me there
   Forevermore. And, haply, soine sweet bard
Might see my grave, and sing, while cooed the dove,
   And breathed the balm of 'fumed air and sward,
Of life and death, and mystery, and love;
   And all the tender hopes that waft us up above.",April,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/james-d-corrothers-author-page
When Sampson Sings,James E. McCall,McCall,"Black Sampson is a singing man;
     He’s blind and big and strong.
A steel guitar is in his hands,
     And in his mouth, a song.

He shuffles up and down the streets,
     Led by a little child;
His voice is vibrant, deep and loud,
     Like the sea when the winds are wild.

There’s sunshine, laughter, pain, and tears,
     In the songs black Sampson sings—
The slave’s sad wail, the warrior’s shout,
     And the laughter of rippling springs.

There’s something in his voice that clings,
     Like Ethiopia’s arms,
Which holds the strength of Pyramids,
     And great Sahara’s charms.
When Sampson sings he holds the throng
     With the spell of his magic bars,
Which thrill like the sound of tom-tom drums,
     On the Congo, under the stars.

The New Negro,James Edward McCall,McCall,"He scans the world with calm and fearless eyes,
Conscious within of powers long since forgot;
At every step, new man-made barriers rise
To bar his progress—but he heeds them not.
He stands erect, though tempests round him crash,
Though thunder bursts and billows surge and roll;
He laughs and forges on, while lightnings flash
Along the rocky pathway to his goal.
Impassive as a Sphinx, he stares ahead—
Foresees new empires rise and old ones fall;
While caste-mad nations lust for blood to shed,
He sees God's finger writing on the wall.

Holding his destiny within his hands.",July,1927,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",Sonnet,male,"Progress and Racial Uplift, Race",Caroling Dusk ,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/james-edward-mccall
The Conjure Man,James Edward McCall,McCall,"An old brown man with snaky eyes
That scintillate and hypnotize--
Serpent-charmer of his race,
With thick red lips, shiny face,
Frayed frock-coat, stove-pipe hat,
Green spectacles, red cravat,
Old umbrella, rusty grip
Filled with roots and herbs to sip--
He can cast an evil spell,
Make you sick or make you well;
He can make a hoodoo charm
To bring good luck and shield you from harm;
Can bring you lover back again,
And make your rival writhe in pain--

And can poison to the heart,
Like a cat on stealthy feet,

Countee Cullen,James Edward McCall,McCall,"Out in the night, I hear a liquid note,
     I pause and listen, as it sweeter grows;
It is a singer with a golden throat, 
     And heart in which the fire of genius glows.
I hear him singing in the twilight hush–
     Caroling songs that warm the heart like sweet wine: 
No sweet-voiced nightingale or hermit-thrush
     Could thrill the world with music more divine. 
Though young in year, he sings as one whose heart 
     Has sung for ages. Yet he wears his crown, 
So modestly that men, thrilled by his art, 
     Pay tribute and forget that his face is brown. 
Unselfishly, his soul seeks to inspire 
     In other souls, divine poetic fire. ",March,1928,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen, George S. Schuyler",Sonnet,male,Intertext,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/james-edward-mccall

Embossed in silver moonlight.
The shadows hid us as we
Plighted our troth and as loving
We did vow eternal faith.
Then we were as precious gems
Deeply set in
A beautiful setting, much as
The beauty of the black opal pierces
The world with laughing lustre
And yet remains serene in the black.

Fifty Years,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"O brothers mine, to-day we stand
      Where half a century sweeps our ken,
    Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,
      Struck off our bonds and made us men.
    Just fifty years--a winter's day--
      As runs the history of a race;
    Yet, as we look back o'er the way,
      How distant seems our starting place!
    Look farther back! Three centuries!
      To where a naked, shivering score,
    Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
      Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.
    Far, far the way that we have trod,
      From heathen kraals and jungle dens,
    To freedmen, freemen, sons of God,
      Americans and Citizens.
    A part of His unknown design,
      We've lived within a mighty age;
    And we have helped to write a line
      On history's most wondrous page.
    A few black bondmen strewn along
      The borders of our eastern coast,
    Now grown a race, ten million strong,
      An upward, onward marching host.
    Then let us here erect a stone,
      To mark the place, to mark the time;
    A witness to God's mercies shown,
      A pledge to hold this day sublime.
    And let that stone an altar be,
      Whereon thanksgivings we may lay,
    Where we, in deep humility,
      For faith and strength renewed may pray.
    With open hearts ask from above
      New zeal, new courage and new pow'rs,
    That we may grow more worthy of
      This country and this land of ours.
    For never let the thought arise
      That we are here on sufferance bare;
    Outcasts, asylumed 'neath these skies,
      And aliens without part or share.
    This land is ours by right of birth,
      This land is ours by right of toil;
    We helped to turn its virgin earth,
      Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
    Where once the tangled forest stood,--
      Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,--
    Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
      The cotton white, the yellow corn.
    To gain these fruits that have been earned,
      To hold these fields that have been won,
    Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
      Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
    That Banner which is now the type
      Of victory on field and flood--
    Remember, its first crimson stripe
      Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.
    And never yet has come the cry--
      When that fair flag has been assailed--
    For men to do, for men to die,
      That have we faltered or have failed.
    We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,
      Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze;
    Held in our hands, it has been borne
      And planted far across the seas.
    And never yet--O haughty Land,
      Let us, at least, for this be praised--
    Has one black, treason-guided hand
      Ever against that flag been raised.
    Then should we speak but servile words,
      Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
    Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
      And fear our heritage to claim?
    No! stand erect and without fear,
      And for our foes let this suffice--
    We've bought a rightful sonship here,
      And we have more than paid the price.
    And yet, my brothers, well I know
      The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
    The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
      The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
    The staggering force of brutish might,
      That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
    The long, vain waiting through the night
      To hear some voice for justice raised.
    Full well I know the hour when hope
      Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere
    Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope
      With hands uplifted in despair.
    Courage! Look out, beyond, and see
      The far horizon's beckoning span!
    Faith in your God-known destiny!
      We are a part of some great plan.
    Because the tongues of Garrison
      And Phillips now are cold in death,
    Think you their work can be undone?
      Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?
    Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?
      That Lovejoy was but idly slain?
    Or do you think those precious drops
      From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?
    That for which millions prayed and sighed,
      That for which tens of thousands fought,
    For which so many freely died,
      God cannot let it come to naught.",,1913,New York Times,,Common Measure,male,"Progress and Racial Uplift, Civil War","Fifty Years and Other Poems, Dunbar Speaker and Entertainer",New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weldon_Johnson

The White Witch,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!    
The great white witch rides out to-night.    
Trust not your prowess nor your strength,    
Your only safety lies in flight;    
For in her glance there is a snare,            
And in her smile there is a blight.    
 
The great white witch you have not seen?    
Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,    
Like nursery children you have looked    
For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;            
But no, not so; the witch appears    
In all the glowing charms of youth.    
 
Her lips are like carnations, red,    
Her face like new-born lilies, fair,    
Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,            
She moves with subtle grace and air,    
And all about her head there floats    
The golden glory of her hair.    
 
But though she always thus appears    
In form of youth and mood of mirth,            
Unnumbered centuries are hers,    
The infant planets saw her birth;    
The child of throbbing Life is she,    
Twin sister to the greedy earth.    
 
And back behind those smiling lips,            
And down within those laughing eyes,    
And underneath the soft caress    
Of hand and voice and purring sighs,    
The shadow of the panther lurks,    
The spirit of the vampire lies.            
 
For I have seen the great white witch,    
And she has led me to her lair,    
And I have kissed her red, red lips    
And cruel face so white and fair;    
Around me she has twined her arms,            
And bound me with her yellow hair.    
 
I felt those red lips burn and sear    
My body like a living coal;    
Obeyed the power of those eyes    
As the needle trembles to the pole;            
And did not care although I felt    
The strength go ebbing from my soul.    
 
Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,    
And heard your laughter loud and gay,    
And in your voices she has caught            
The echo of a far-off day,    
When man was closer to the earth;    
And she has marked you for her prey.    
 
She feels the old Antaean strength    
In you, the great dynamic beat            
Of primal passions, and she sees    
In you the last besieged retreat    
Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,    
Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.    
 
O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!            
The great white witch rides out to-night.    
O, younger brothers mine, beware!    
Look not upon her beauty bright;

And in her smile there is a blight. ",March,1915,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,Interracial,The Book of American Negro Poetry,New York,Predom. Black,"https://poets.org/poet/james-weldon-johnson#:~:text=Johnson%20wrote%20and%20edited%20numerous,a%20year%20later%20by%20The"

Brothers,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter's trap.

How came this beast in human shape and form?
Speak, man! - We call you man because you wear
His shape-How are you thus? Are you not from
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
Which we have known three centuries? Not from
That more than faithful race which through three wars
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!

   I am, and am not.
      Then who, why are you?
   I am a thing not new, I am as old

As human nature. I am that which lurks,
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
The ancient trait which fights incessantly
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
The weight forever seeking to obey
The law of downward pull; and I am more:
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
   Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
Filtered through fifteen generations have
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
In me the muttered curse of dying men,
On me the stain of conquered women, and
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
Of wretches now long dead,--their dire bequests,--
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their bartered mothers' breasts.

I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
I am-just what I am . . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
To-day, but I -
Enough, the brute must die!
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
The fire much longer than this slender pine.
Now bring the fuel! Pile it 'round him! Wait!
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
And there's another! Wilder than the first.
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
Searching around in vain appeal for help!
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.

Stop! to each man no more than one man's share.
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain -
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
In fair division, to the leader comes.

And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
Let us back to our wives and children. - Say,
What did he mean by those last muttered words,
'Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we'?

Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet

Like the wheeling flight of a gull,
Like smoke hanging high in the blue
In vaporish traceries,—
Without sound, but significant
As a thunder-preceding lull.

A column of sand-pipers
Marching meticulously
Over the sedge-strewn floor of the beach;
Slight and graceful, unswerving
As war-going fifers;
Persistent, purposeful, sure,—
And just beyond reach!
Easily, far too easily

Yet if once I recall it
There springs to my mind perfection;
Perfection of sky and sun
And ocean and weather
Promised fulfilment, of yearning,
Assurance of heaven's protection.

How you make me think of trees,
Ships and gulls and flashing seas!
In your furious, tearing wind,
Swells a chant that heals my mind;
And your passion high and proud,
Makes me shout and laugh aloud!

Autumn rains that start at dawn,
‘Dropping veils of thinnest lawn’;
Soaking sod between dank grasses,
Sweeping golden leaves in masses,-
Blotting, blurring out the Past,
In a dream you hold me fast;
Calling, coaxing to forget
Thing that are, for things not yet.

Winter tempest, winter rain,
Hurtling down with might and main,
You but make me hug my heart,
Laughing, sheltered from your wrath.
Now I woo my dancing fire,
Piling, piling drift-wood higher.
Books and friends and pictures old,
Hearten while you pound and scold!

Pattering wistful showers of Spring
Set me to remembering
Far-off times and lovers too,
Gentle joys and heart-break rue,-
Memories I’d as lief forget,
Were not oblivion sadder yet.
Ah! you twist my mind with pain,
Wistful whispering April rain!

How you ease my heart of pain!
Whispering, wistful showers of Spring,
How I love the hurt you bring!

Of endless serfdom for thy years.

Unwritten History,John Riley Dungee,Dungee,"MINE is the humble duty and endeavor to relate
A point of information that the hist'rics don't narrate.
Of our country's cause and conflicts, and the progress she has made
They tell us, but are silent on the part the Negro played.

We weren't at the discovery of this delightful land,
But throughout its development is seen our humble hand .
We felled the forests hewed the way for emigration's tide;
We reaped the grain and hoed the fields of cane and cotton wide.

We led the first resistance against the despot's sway,
When from our land he sought to take her liberties away.
We fought throughout the conflict with unselfish resolution,
And, vict'ry won, our suffrage helped to frame the Constitution.

'Twas not our fault our valor and devotion were forgotten;
'Twas not our choice that we were made the victims of King Cotton;
Unwillingly we were the cause, unfortunate, that rent
The Union we would willingly have suffered to cement.

Though our consent was not required, yet do we claim the merit
Of multiplying hoards of wealth for others to inherit.
Were half the country's lands and goods converted into gold,
'Twould not exceed the revenue for which our labor sold.

Our constant care and faithfulness were levied to provide
Comfort and case for those by whom our freedom was denied.
We tended them in infancy, in sickness and in age,
No want of theirs, nor whim, that failed our service to engage.

And when dread palpitation shook the nation's troubled heart,
'Twas our peculiar destiny to play a triple part.
While thousands fought their chains to break, some wrought to weld them faster;
Others remained the home on guard to aid and succor master.

With internecine clouds o'erblown, and peace again returned,---
And amity and happiness with our assistance carned,
Our service and our sacrifice we've failed not to devote,
Our country's cause to honor and her glory to promote.

Then wherefore do our virtues all escape the public eye?
Wherefore our imperfections do they seek to magnify?
How can our land, our native land, her treachery excuse?
The merit of our loyalty, how long will she refuse?

Of all the blood her freedom cost the Negro shed the first;
Of all whom freedom ought to bless the Negro fares the worst.
She never can repair the loss of what she took away;
The debt of gratitude she owes she never can repay.

The hist'ries we peruse in vain in quest of what I've stated,
Yet justice will admit my claim is not exaggerated.

In every worthy work and way the Negro plays his part.",April,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,male,"Slavery, Civil War",,Boston,Predom. Black,

The Resurrection,Jonathan H. Brooks,Brooks,"His friends went off and left Him dead
in Joseph's subterranean bed,
Embalmed with myrrh and sweet aloes,
And wrapped in snow-white burial clothes.
Then shrewd men came and set a seal
Upon His grave, lest thieves should steal
His lifeless form away, and claim
For Him an undeserving fame.
“There is no use,” the soldiers said,
“Of standing sentries by the dead.”
Wherefore, they drew their cloaks around
Themselves, and fell upon the ground,
And slept like dead men, all night through,
In the pale moonlight and chilling dew.
A muffled whiff of sudden breath
Ruffled the passive air of death.
He woke, and raised Himself in bed;
Recalled how He was crucified;
Touched both hand's fingers to His head,
And lightly felt His fresh-healed side,
Then with a deep, triumphant sigh,
He coolly put His grave-clothes by—
Folded the sweet, white winding sheet,
     The toweling, the linen bands,
The napkin, all with careful hands—
And left the borrowed chamber neat.
His steps were like the breaking day:
So soft across the watch He stole,
He did not wake a single soul,
Nor spill one dewdrop by the way.
Now Calvary was loveliness:
     Lilies that flowered thereupon
Pulled off the white moon's pallid dress,
     And put the morning's vesture on.
“Why seek the living among the dead?
He is not here,” the angel said.

And bore them to the lilting birds,

He saw Life jaded by the mystic Nile,
While weaving tapestry of brick and sone

Then whispered to himself: 'Nor tribe, nor clime,
Nor God, nor Devil can unwed the ages.'

   With Douglass, great and wise and good,
   Devoted womanhood—
'Round both our garlands twine .
In union strong throughout the land,
A consecrated band,
   A service measureless they wrought
   When Cedar Hill they bought
And saved from alien hand.

Fear not, faint not, O sable race!
The truth naught can efface
   Is writ on ev'ry passing breeze;
   With women such as these
Our fight is won a-pace.

Just a little tired, waiting
Through the night
For the new day to be breaking 
Into light.
Just a little tired, yearning
For the blast 
In the land of no returning
God-and rest.
Just a little tired, trying
Yet again–
To smile and cease the crying 
Through the pain.
Just a little tired, bending
“Neath the rod,
Though the rough, bleak way is wending 
Up to God.
Just a little tired, facing
Blows that fall
Unexpected; tired placing
Trust in all.
Just a little tired, falling–
Blund’ring here.
Ideals gone beyond recalling
Friends once dear. 
Just a little tired, waiting
Through the night 
For the new morn to be breaking
Clear and bright.

Slave's Song,Kelsey Percival Kitchel,Kitchel,"Ah, whether I loved you, who can say?
What of the chaff that lies i’ the way
Of the wind blown off of the desert grey?

You choose me for love and I went with you 
Yielding as reeds that the stream runs through–
What was a broken heart to you?
(But you taught me to love you well!) 
Un-eager I was for your first long kiss– 
Unstirred was my blood to your touch that is
Today of fire, for Beloved, this
Is verily love’s own spell.

Or break or yet to with your own to blend.
Ah, Master, keep me until the end–
I have learned to love too well!

My Little Love Salome,L.A. Proctor,Proctor,"I have wander’d late and early to the spot I love so dearly,
Where the scent of honeysuckle mingles with the tender rose.
There the incense sweet and holy sheathing me, I dreaming only
While a subtle spell fast held me as the mist above me posted.
A sweet fragrance as of clover all around me seem’d to hover.
While a secret power charmed me and my senses idly roam’d.
Then a magic something shower’d and a halo ‘round me flowered
While I courted fancy notions of my little love Salome. 
I have faced from climates warmer, white and dusky wily charmers,
And I’ve watched their flirting eyelash and their actions blithe or shy
But withal their fetching manner did not charm me nor enamor,
I saw nothing in their graces that was pleasing to my eye.
But the rose to me so sweetly cooing, loving so discreetly,
Sends a summons of devotion ev’ry place that I may roam.
For she is a gem completely, clad in robes precise and neatly.
And the bond of love is lasting between me and sweet Salome.

Refining Fire ,L.A.J. Moorer,Moorer,"What a cost to be pure! did it e'er strike your mind
That the gold so much prized in the fire was refined?
And the pearls of the deep by the divers are found,
At the peril of life their successess are crowned ?

Yea, the trees of the orchard the pruner must know,
If they bring forth the best of the fruit that can grow;
And the knife is applied to the vine ev'rywhere,
For production, of grapes that are luscious and rare.

Thus in life we are taught by the pain and the loss,
That the road to the crown is by way of the cross;
Christians pass through the furnace, the Savior to gain,
For with Him if they suffer, with Him shall they reign.

We may weep for a night but the morn bringeth joy,
Then the songs of rejoicing our tongues will employ;
Ev'ry storm that ariseth at some time must end,
Then the rainbow of promise and peace will attend.

Ev'ry soul must afflictions and trouble endure,
As the gold must be tried, so the soul to be pure,
As the pearl is secured at the peril of life,
So the soul in its triumph must pass through the strife.

Like the Savior who suffered and went to His rest,
Must His servants on earth find the home of the blest,
There to tell Him the story of how in the past
They suffered the crosses and are crowned at the last.",February,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,Male,Religion,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,

Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light

He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.

Coming from a black man's soul.

   Ain't got nobody but ma self.
   I's gwine to quit ma frownin'
   And put ma troubles on the shelf.”

   And I wish that I had died.”

   came between us
   green and slimy
   like sickly laughter
   and a bowl was broken
   from which
   we could not drink thereafter
   and we turned around
   and threw
   the shattered bits
   upon the ground
   and went our separate ways
   into the town
   and a clock
   somewhere in a tower
   boomed out slowly
   hour after hour
   a great cracked
   broken sound.

What can a colored girl do
On the money from a white woman’s kitchen?
And: Ain’t there any joy in this town?

Now the streets down by the river
Know more about this pretty Ruby Brown,
And the sinister shuttered houses of the Bottoms
Hold a yellow girl

Pay more money to her now than they ever did before,

The Childhood of Jimmy,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"The Town
I lived with my aunt in a small town. There were lots of colored people there. It was a nice town with trees in it and at the end of our street a river and a little house where a colored man sold whisky and sometimes beer .   .   .   My aunt liked our town. She said she always lived there. My uncle liked our town, too .  .  .  He washed his overalls in the backyard on Sundays .   .   .  There were two churches in our town.

The School
There were colored children in the town school. All the little colored children were in one room and the teacher was colored, too. I don’t think she liked
the school.   .   .  When I was in the third grade I went into another room with the white children and the teacher was white, too. I don’t think she liked the school either. She said we were all bad children.  .   .   Sometimes they slapped me in the school.

The Difference
You’re a nigger. You ain’t as good as I am ‘cause you're a nigger.  .  . Paul said that to me but he didn’t mean to hurt me when he said it. He was my friend. We played games together all the time and we went to the woods on Saturdays to look for May apples and
birds . . . He said you ain’t as good as I am. You're a nigger, but he didn’t mean to hurt me.   .   .  I asked my aunt what I should say when Paul said you're a nigger. I liked Paul so I asked my aunt what I should say.

The Soul
God! I ain’t afraid of God! Earl said, and God didn’t strike him dead.  .  .  Come all ye who love the Lord and lay your burdens down. They sang slow in church Sunday morning. It was Revival Day and Earl went up and sat on the mourner’s bench.  .  .  And I went up, too, ashamed . . . Come all ye who love the Lord . . . and my aunt was kneeling down beside me praying.  .  .   and the old folks in the amen-corner were praying .  .  . And the preacher said do you love God? And I said yes. And the preacher said do you accept Him? And I said yes. And I was converted . . . And my aunt got up and the old folks screamed hallelujah and sang glory to the name of the Lord.  .  .  And I went home
and cried in bed because I was ashamed.  .  . I didn’t love God . . . And I was ashamed to lie about I didn’t love God.

The Body
My aunt said be careful about girls.  . . Clarence, next door, was the father of a baby.  .  . Clarence was sixteen years old.  .  .  Clarence was arrested and had to marry the mother
of his baby.  .  .  My aunt said be careful about girls.  .  . I went to her house at four o'clock in the afternoon. She said I should come.  .  . My aunt said be careful about girls.  .  . I didn’t know much about girls.  .  . Her mother worked all day in Mrs. Ronnermann’s kitchen. Her mother didn’t get home until after supper.  .  . My aunt said be careful about girls . . . She said I should come. Her mother didn’t get home until after supper . . . Be careful about girls.

Death
My grandmother died on Thursday.  .  . Grandmother.  .  . I didn’t want her to die on Thursday.  .  . Every Thursday I sold papers and I missed selling papers because she died on Thursday.  .  . Somebody woke me up at three o'clock in the morning because my grandmother was dead. I went outdoors looking for my grandmother.  .  . She wasn’t there. The moon was there, cold and ugly, but no ghost of my g r a n d m o t h e r . . . They wrapped her up in sheets and sent her away to the undertaker’s. I didn’t sell any papers on Thursday.  .  .  missed my grandmother . . . We moved away to another town. I went to another school. I didn’t sell any more papers on Thursdays. I went to work in a big hotel.  .  . I missed my grandmother.

Walking in the dewy night,
And black slaves
Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
Mingle themselves softly
In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,
Mingle themselves softly
In the dark shadows that cross and recross
Aunt Sue's stories.

And the dark-faced child, listening,
Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.
He knows that Aunt Sue
Never got her stories out of any book at all,
But that they came
Right out of her own life.

And the dark-faced child is quiet

And I know I've seen you in a New York subway train in the late afternoon coming home from washing clothes.
Yes, I know you, wash-woman.
I know how you send your children to school, and high-school, and even college.
I know how you work and help your man when times are hard.
I know how you build your house up from the wash-tub and call it home.
And how you raise your churches from white suds for the service of the Holy God.
And I've seen you singing, wash-woman. Out in the backyard garden under the apple trees, singing, hanging white clothes on long lines in the sun-shine.
And I've seen you in church a Sunday morning singing, praising your Jesus, because some day you're going to sit on the right hand of the Son of God and forget you ever were a wash-woman. And the aching back and the bundles of clothes will be unremembered then.
Yes, I've seen you singing.

To Beauty,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"To worship
At the altar of Beauty,
To feel her loveliness and pain,
To thrill
At the wonder of her gorgeous moon
Or the sharp, swift, silver swords
Of falling rain.

To walk in a golden garden
When an autumn sun
Has almost set,
When near-night’s purple splendor
Shimmers to a star-shine net.

To worship
At the altar of Beauty
Is a pleasure divine,
Not given to the many many
But to fools
Who drink Beauty’s wine.
Not given to the many many
But to fools
Who seek no other goddess
Nor grapes
Plucked from another’s
Vine.

Once looked I into hell--'twas in a trance
Throughout a horrid night of soul-wrought pain;
Down through the pit I saw the burning plain,
Where writhed tortured swarm without one glance
Upward to earth or God. There in advance 
Of all the rest was one with lips profane
And murderous, bloody hands, marked to be slain
by peers that would not bear him countance.
'God,' cried I in my dream, 'what soul is he
Doomed thus to drain the utmost cup of fate,
That even the cursed of Tartarus expel?'
And the great Voice replied: 'The chastity
Of dear, confiding Law he raped; now Hate,
His own begotten, drives him forth from hell.""",January,1912,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,"Lynching and Racialized Violence, Racism, Religion",,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/leslie-pinckney-hill-author-page

Waits patiently, remembering that each
Must strive within its nature as it can

Whose leaves are healing and whose fruit is peace.

On sturdy wings of fearless thought.
Then come the dreams which through the day
The moil of living shuts away .

While all the universe is still,
From streams of quietness that rise
Out of the hills of Paradise.

And I can tell the day was meant
For some design beneficent,
For sweet-imagined sounds I hear,
And forms of beauty hover near
To win me to the perfect trust

Armageddon,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"Armageddon

Written at the outbreak of the World War ,just after President Wilson's appeal to the country for a ""poise of undisturbed judgment,” — to express the significance to the trammeled millions of colored people the world over, and especially to the American Negro, of that spirit of the times which well nigh destroyed civilization.

""Where is the wise? where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? . But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise: and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which arc despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence.""— Paul.

""What is all this but a wild fermentation of the spirit, wherefrom, the fiercer it is, the clearer product will one day evolve itself.""—Carlyle

BEFORE the whirlwind and the thunder shock,
The agony of nations, and this wild
Eruption of the passionate will of man,
These tottering bastions of mighty states,
This guillotine of culture, and this new
Unspeakable Golgotha of the Christ,
My heart declares her faith, and, undismayed,
I write her prompting—write it in that poise
Of judgment undisturbed to which our Head
Admonishes the nation.

                                But have I
A certain warrant? Does the cannon roar
Above the mangled myriads washed in blood
Upon a hundred fields embolden me
To vent the doctrine of a private heart !
Nay, ask it not, for God hath chosen still
The weak thing, and the foolish, and the base,
And that which is despised to work His will;
And humble men are chartered yet to run
Upon His errands round the groaning sphere.
Not many of the mighty shall be called,
Not many that dispute, not many wise,
That so the prophecy may be fulfilled.
Among the least of men of many strains,
Whose origin outdates the pyramids,
Uncherished of my country — though the blood
Of all my fathers ran to make her free
Known by a name that typifies the slave,
Synonymous with darkness, and by that
Set in the ranks of mortals least esteemed,
I claim no merit save the love of truth,
And care to find for her a lodging- place.
I have been bred and born beneath the stern
Duress and cold inhospitality
Of that environment which prejudice
Fills consciously with bane; and I have sought
Blessed be the God of mercy — at the shrine
Of thought inviolate the wells of peace.

There, fortified and unmolested, long
Have I in contemplation rued the plight
Of all my kind, and reverently aspired
To ponder out our mission, unconvinced
That we are born the dupes of Providence,
To be a nation's burden and her taunt,
Or Ishmaels of an unchosen land.

My quest has been to know the good of life,
And why a race should be, and what endures
Of that which man has called society,
And - last and highest aim of these pursuits
To learn what perfect service, born of throes
Dreadful but purgative, we yet might dare
To offer thee, O country of our hope.
And from these musings — thanks to Him
Whose citadels are stars, with time and space
Their pylons, but Who builds His favored home
Upon the docile trust of lowly hearts
Proceeded comfort, patience to endure,
And strength increasing of a faith sublime
Which neither infidelity in arms,
Nor all the bitter usage of the world
Can e'er avail to tarnish or impair.
For looking out upon the world I saw
No hope for future man in those who stand
Upon the heights of power, save in the tales
Transmitted of their slow decline and fall.
Because they spurn the truth of brotherhood,
And trade in life, and mock the living God
By high contempt of all His humbler sons,
The strong battalions of eternal right
And nature's law make their discomfort sure.

They prove the error of that pride of race
And nation which has been the world's despite,
And unloosed Mammon for a thousand years.
Not all their transient lordship of the earth,
Their cunning in the traffic of the world,
The condescension of their patronage,
Or thundering proclamations of their might,
Can check the springs of pity, while our prayers
Besiege the throne of mercy for their weal.

But looking in upon my stricken peers,
I saw upon their swarthy brows “the gleam;""
I saw the lineaments of hope new-born
For peoples yet to be. O scorn it not,
Ye mighty of all lands, ye that are raised
To glory on the necks of trampled men !
For now within your midst are multitudes
Puissant though despised, meek men of prayer,
Dark, shackled knights of labor, clinging still
Amidst a universal wreck of faith
To cheerfulness, and foreigners to hate.
These know ye not, these have ye not received,
But these shall speak to you Beatitudes.

Around them surge the tides of all your strife,
Above them rise the august monuments
Of all your outward splendor, but they stand
Unenvious in thought, and bide their time.
Because ye schooled them in the arts of life,
And gave to them your God, and poured your blood
Into their veins to make them what they are,
They shall not fail you in your hour of need.

They hold in them enough of you to feel
All that has made you masters in your time
The power of art and wealth, unending toil,
Proud types of beauty, an unbounded will
To triumph, wondrous science, and old law
These have they learned to value and to share.
But deeper in them still is something steeled
To hot abhorrence and unmeasured dread
Of your undaunted sins against the light
Red sins of lust, of envy and of greed,
Of guilty gain extorted from the weak,
Of brotherhood traduced and God denied.

All this have they beheld without revolt,
And borne the brunt in agonizing prayer.
For those deep strains of blood that flow from times
Older than Egypt, whence the dark man gave
The rudiments of learning to all lands,
Have been a strong constraint. And they have dreamed
Of a peculiar mission under heaven,
And felt the force of unexampled gifts
That make for them a rare inheritance
The gift of cheerful confidence in men,
The gift of calm endurance, solacing
An infinite capacity for pain,
The gift of an unfeigned humility
That blinds the eyes of strident arrogance
And bigot pride to that philosophy
And that far-glancing wisdom which it veils,
The gift of feeling for all forms of life,
Of deathless hope in trouble, and of wide
Adaptive power without a parallel
In chronicles of men, and over all,
And more than all besides, the gift of God
Expressed in rhythmic miracles of song.

O these are gifts, I said a thousand times
Richer than Ophir, stronger than the might
Of armament to conquer and to cure
Gifts destined yet to permeate the earth,
To heal it of its mighty heresies,
And all its brutal blasphemy of war.
So viewing all my brothers in distress,
Hindered and cursed and aliens, I have wept
And prayed for them in solitude apart,
That they might know themselves a chosen folk,
Unrecognized but potent, chastened still,
But chartered to be ministers of truth,
To search the depths of spirit, to go forth
To woo and win a perfect self-control,
To breed strong children exercised in prayer,
Shunning as they would death the patterns set
By those who hold the kingdoms and the sway.
So might they with the pregnant years become
New arbiters of social destiny,
New health veins in the body politic,
A high-commissioned people, mingled through
With all the bloods of man, and, counselling
Peace, and the healing grace of brotherhood,
""Have power in this dark world to lighten it,
And power in this dead world to make it live.""

When through my being, like a lyre strung,
These winds of temporal occurrence sweep,
I hear a kind of music, high and low,
And ranging from the tortured earth to heaven,
Throbbing with tragic cadence to express
The passing and the coming life of man .
And though the tempests rage and earth be stirred
To her foundations, though the lucid air
Become a menace, and the beauteous world
Be bathed in fire, I am undismayed.
The cataclysmic travail prophecies
The dawn of one world-conscience for all men,
The breaking up of caste and race and creed,
The warfare of all war against itself.
And hence in my low place this living peace
That grows and deepens, while the staggered frames
Of ancient kingdoms reel beneath a weight
Of crimes so vast that genius strives in vain
To compass them in thought: for out of this,
The spirit saith, shall issue other breeds
Soul-burdened like my brothers, and like them
Despised and trammeled, but sent forth to teach
That nothing in the changing world endures
But truth and love and brotherhood and God .",June,1915,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,"World War I, Religion, Racism",,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/leslie-pinckney-hill-author-page

Tree Meditation ,Lewis Alexander,Alexander,"How very like a tree
Alas am I
And like to bursting blossoms
Are my thoughts.
Some will remain upon the tree
And fruit
And others fall
And drift far on the stream.
For those that drift T
here shall be no returning;
But those which fruit
Shall burst and scatter seed.
The seed shall stand
A flowering tree again
Each generation stronger than the last.
I'm but the tree!
Would I were soil or water.
I could not face the agony of death—
Eternally to mother tree and seedling
And breathe the beauty of the blossom time.
Being the tree
I needs must face the shedding
Bear the fruit which bursts
And flowers which fall;
Standing helpless see them drift down stream
To sea—
Where there shall be no coming back! ",May,1928,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,Free verse,male,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Grandison_Alexander

Song of the American Dove,Lucian Watkins,Watkins,"I build my nest not on the crest
Of the mountain-throne, but in the breast–
The sheltering arm of the forest warm,
Where my dovelets swing ‘mid the maddest storm;
Here I see and sigh! ‘neath the grieving sky, 
Lo, a race is hung on the trees!
A-wing I go, and the land below 
Is riot-red with a cruel woe;
For the hand of Hate, at a furious rate,
Is sowing the seeds of a terrible fate;
And each venomous seed is the prejudice weed
That buds and blooms with a murderous deed!
Oh, I love the land of Justice grand, 
Where men are free, heart, head and hand;
Where the smile and nod of the greening sod
Are bright and and glad with the gift of God:
Where over the plains and the mountainous reigns
The flag that frees each soul from chains!
“Land of the free,” whose flag I see!
What boots thy boast of Liberty? 
 What avails thy might, while in thy sight
A race is robbed of its dearest right?
Hark! I hear the yell of the hounds of hell–
Thy sons obsessed with the lynching spell!
How I long to see thy Liberty
With e’en thy lowliest subject free;
With none denied or crushed in pride,
But souls ascending side by side;
Thy streaming Stars and bleeding Bars
Thus mean a victory more than war’s!
“Let freedom ring”- ‘tis a well to sing, 
But let it from the mountains bring–
Not only to the fortunate few–
Its peace to all ‘neath the “Red, White and Blue!”
Ah! I see and sigh, ‘neath the heavens high,
While a race is hung on the trees to die!

Goal ,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"My words shall drip
Like molten lava
From the towering black volcano,
On the sleeping town
’Neath its summit.

Hot ashes
Burning all in its path.

Because critics sneer,
Nor stoop to fawning
At man’s mere fancy.
I shall breathe

For I shall see the sun
Above the crowd, 
I shall not blush
And make excuse
When a son of Adam,
Who calls himself
“God’s Layman,”
Slashes with scorn
A thing born from
Truth’s womb and nursed
By beauty. It will not
Matter who stoops
To cast the first stone.
Does not my spirit
Soar above these feeble
Minds? thoughts born
From prejudice’s womb
And nursed by tradition? 
I will shatter the wall
Of darkness that rises
From gleaming day
And seeks to hide the sun.
I will turn this wall of 
Darkness (that is night)
Into a thing of beauty.
I will take from the hearts
Of black men--

Hot, burning sand

Caught by the wind,
Swirling, stinging, swarting,
Silver in the moonlight.
Soft breath of lovers’ feet
Lulled to sleep by the lap of waves,
The wind blows—
It is summer!
The wind blows.
My soul is still
In silent reverie
Hearing sometimes a sigh
As the frost steals over the land
Nipping everywhere.

Awaits the coming of

Of the Earth ,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"A mountain
Is earth's mouth . . .
She thrusts her lovely
Sun painted lips
To the clouds . . . for heaven's kiss.
A tree
Is earth's soul . . .
She raises her verdant
Joyous prayer
To the slowly sinking sun
And to evening's dew.
She flings her rugged defiance
To hell's grumbling wrath
And deadly smile;
Then rustles her thanksgiving
To the dawn.

Is earth's tears . . .
Flowing from her deep brown bosom

A Prayer,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"I saw a dark boy
     Trudging on the road
(Twas’ a dreary road Blacker than night).
     Oft times he'd stumble
And stagger 'neath his burden
     But still he kept trudging
Along that dreary road.

I heard a dark boy
     Singing as he passed
Oft times he'd laugh
     But still a tear
Crept thru his song,
     As he kept trudging
Along that weary road .

I saw a long white mist roll down
     And cover all the earth
(There wasn't even a shadow
     To tell it was night).
And then there came an echo . . . .
 . . . . Footsteps of a dark boy
Still climbing on the way.

A song with its tear
     And then a prayer
From the lips of a dark boy
     Struggling thru the fog.
Oft times I'd hear

     The lashing of a whip
And then a voice would cry to heaven
     “Lord! . . . Lord!
     Have mercy! . . . . mercy!”
And still that bleeding body
     Pushed onward thru the fog .
Song . . . . Tears . . . . Blood . . . . Prayer
     Throbbing thru the mist.

The mist rolled by
     And the sun shone fair,
Fair and golden
     On a dark boy . . . . cold and still
High on a bare bleak tree
     His face upturned to heaven
His soul upraised in song
     “Peace. . . . Peace
     Rest in the Lord.”

Oft times in the twilight
     I can hear him still singing
As he walks in the heavens,
     A song without a tear
A prayer without a plea.

Lord, lift me up to the purple sky
     That lays its hand of stars
Tenderly on my bowed head
     As I kneel high on this barren hill.
My song holds naught but tears
     My prayer is but a plea
Lord take me to the clouds
     To sleep . . . to sleep.

Longings,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"To dance—
In the light of moon,
A platinum moon
Poised like a slender dagger
On the velvet darkness of night.

To dream—
’Neath the bamboo trees
On the sable breast
Of earth—
And listen to the wind.

To croon—
Weird sweet melodies
Round the cabin door
With banjos clinking softly—
And from out the shadow
Hear the beat of tom-toms
Resonant through the years.

To plunge—
My brown body
In a golden pool,
And lazily float on the swell
Watching the rising sun.

To stand—
On a purple mountain
Hidden from earth
By mists of dreams
And tears—

To talk—
With God.

Lamps,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"Bodies are lamps
And their life is the light.
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony—
Yet all are lamps
And their lives the lights.

Dwelling in the tabernacles
    Of the most high—are lamps.
Lighting the weary pilgrims’ way
    As they travel the dreary night—are lamps.
Swinging aloft in great Cathedrals
    Beaming on rich and poor alike—are lamps.
Flickering fitfully in harlot dives
    Wanton as they that dwell therein— are lamps.
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony—
Yet all are lamps
And their lives the lights.

Some flames rise high above the horizon
    And urge others to greater power.
Some burn steadfast thru the night
    To welcome the prodigal home.
Others flicker weakly, lacking oil to burn
    And slowly die unnoticed.
What matter how bright the flame
    How weak?
What matter how high it blazes
    How low?
A puff of wind will put it out.

You and I are lamps—Ebony lamps,
Our flame glows red and rages high within
But our ebon shroud becomes a shadow
And our light seems weak and low.
    Break that shadow
    And let the flame illumine heaven
    Or blow wind…blow
    And let our feeble lights go out.

The silver stars
That grow in heaven's dark blue meadows
And bury my face in them.

The silver shedding of the moon
To keep me warm.

I want to sell my soul
To the wind in a song
To keep me from crying in the night.

Only nights are kind now . . .

Black Flute,Marion Cuthbert,Cuthbert,"He had taken a reed and made him stops
And set it to his mouth,
And was strolling along our careless street
That follows the river south—
A black boy and a reedy flute,
A black child skipped behind—
A white man, following, laughed and said,
“This is a lucky find!
That boy can swing a better pick
Than any man at the Dam,
But who'd a thought o° music and him!
Lawd! any black boy can lam
A tune out o° a cast iron pipe,
Or a wooden railroad tie—
If they couldn’t open up and sing
Every last one ‘d die!”
But I was plashing on the brink
Of a sleepy river wide,
Playing hide and seek in reeds
That covered the shallow side;
I was swinging from a vine
That gripped a mighty tree,
Higher and higher, pulsing, glad,
A rhythm of eternity;
I was dancing in a glade,
The moon and | were mad,
Till cool, dewed grass held quivering limbs
And breath was the pain I had;
I was lost in a night-black wood,
And heard a clear birdsong:
Dropping in weariness, I dreamt
That walking I found the dawn—
The reedy flute was under the hill,
Each went back to his task.
A black god caught us unaware,
We dropped each needful mask
Hiding the child-face that must light
When a flute player passes by—

A Picture,Olivia Ward Bush-Banks,Bush-Banks,"I drew a picture long ago —
A picture of a sullen sea;
A picture that I value now
Because it clears Life’s mystery.
My sea was dark and full of gloom;
I painted rocks of sombre hue.
My sky alone bespoke of light,
And that I painted palest blue.
But e’en across my sky of blue
Stretched troubled clouds of sodden gray,
Through which the sun shone weak and dim,
With only here and there a ray.
Around my rocks the yellow foam
Seemed surging, moaning in despair
As if the waves, their fury spent,
Left naught but desolation there.
Three crafts with fluttering sails I drew,
And one sailed near the rocks of gray,
The other on its westward course,
Went speeding out of danger’s way.
The other still outdistanced them
Where sky and water seemed to meet.
I painted that with sails full set,
And then my picture was complete.
My life was like the sullen sea,
Misfortune’s woes, my rocks of gray;
The crafts portrayed Life’s changing scenes,
The clouded sky Life’s troubled Day
I long to paint that picture o’er,
Without the rocks of sombre hue;
Without the troubled clouds of gray,
I’ll paint the sky of brightest blue.
My sea shall lay in calm repose,
No hint of surging, moaning sigh.
My crafts, unhindered by the rocks,
Shall speed in joyous swiftness by.
But this will be when brightest hours
Of hope and cheer are given me.

They feel the urge-they hold out helping hands,
And upward keep their way.

The Colored Girl,Omah Neal,Neal,"OH colored girl of thee I sing!
Thy virtue like the sun and dew
Distill the sweets which to thee cling;
Tho ' of dark race yet all the world,
Shall praises great to thee long bring.

Altho ' oppressed oh, dark race girl,
Be proud of thy high destiny ,
With wisdom clear thy flag unfurl;
And with increasing lustre shine;
Thy fame around the nations curl .

From depths of great obscurity
Thou comest clothed with beauty rare,
And good sense linked with purity,
Which takes us far on life's rough road ,
Where joins with womanhood duty.

None lauds thy name; few duty moves
To plead to cause; who honors thee
Sweet maid? Alas! it now behooves
Us hang our heads, because we have
Not done the things which duty proves.

Oppressed were Jews, in olden days,
When Pharoahs ruled; but since have come
Their Hannahs, Marys, their bright rays
Awaken Jewish men, gave them
A higher aim in many ways.

Can go we neither up nor down,
Where equal rignts are hard to find,
Or wear with fame or shame a crown,
Unless each step we have thee near,
With lovely smile or ugly frown.

Filled with the spirit of the sage,
With wisdom bathe our dauntless souls,
And with a knowledge of the age,
Remove the wrongs which clog our way
And which to-day so strong engage.",May,1908,Colored American,Fred R. Moore,,,Race: Black Beauty,,New York,Predom. Black,

Rest in a sad, sweet peace.

With the smoke of my soul,
With my last breath,
Tar-feathered, I shall cry:
Ethiopia shall not die!
And hand in hand with Death,
Pass on!
I shall not curse you. But singing–
My singing! fatefully ringing
Till startled and dumb 
You falter, the sum 
Of your crime shall reveal– 
This do I prophesy…
O Heart wrung dry!
Awake!
Startle the world with thy cry:
Ethiopia shall not die!

Mammy,Otto Bohanan,Bohanan,"She held him in her bronzen arms
   And fed him from her lavish breast,
And rid him of a child's alarms,
   With songs that gave him rest.

He loved her tenderly, he said,
   And vowed to fill her life with pleasure.
He's growing old and she is dead,
   A picture in his memory's treasure.

But once he paused upon the bench
   Ere yet he spake the final sentence
Upon a slender black-faced wench,
   Whose eyes were grime with unrepentance:

""Old Mammy's child! Tut! Tut! 'Tis bad
   For one so young to mock the law.
Your mother's eyes must deepen sad,
   She looked upon these things with awe.""

And what hast thou now but thy dusty tears?
In silence she rubbed . . . But her face I had seen,
Where the light of her soul fell shining and clean.

   And Night drops tears.
Where Faith rod-chastened smiles to rise

And carping Sorrow pines and dies

Disappointed,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar," An old man planted and dug and tended,
    Toiling in joy from dew to dew;
  The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;
    Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
  Then he said: ""I will quiet my thrifty fears,
  For here is fruit for my failing years.""

  But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
    Swallowing up the azure sky;
  The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
    The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
  Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
  Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.

  The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
    Viewing the place the storm had swept;
  And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
    He bowed him down to the earth and wept.
  But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;
  ""Arise, old man, and plant again!""",June,1908,Colored American,Fred R. Moore,,male,,Lyrics of Lowly Life,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar
Frederick Douglass,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"A hush is over all the teeming lists,
And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife;
A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists
And vapors that obscure the sun of life.
And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,
Laments the passing of her noblest born.

She weeps for him a mother's burning tears--
She loved him with a mother's deepest love
He was her champion thro' direful years,
And held her weal all other ends above.
When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,
He raised her up and whispered, ""Hope and Trust.""

For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung
That broke in warning on the ears of men;
For her the strong bow of his pow'r he strung
And sent his arrows to the very den
Where grim Oppression held his bloody place
And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.

And he was no soft-tongued apologist;
He spoke straight-forward, fearlessly uncowed;
The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist
And set in bold relief each dark-hued cloud;
To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,
And hurled at evil what was evil's due.

Thro' good and ill report he cleaved his way
Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,
Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array--
The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.
He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,
And answered thunder with his thunder back.

When men maligned him and their torrent wrath
In furious imprecations o'er him broke,
He kept his counsel as he kept his path;
'Twas for his race, not for himself, he spoke.
He knew the import of his Master's call
And felt himself too mighty to be small.

No miser in the good he held was he--
His kindness followed his horizon's rim.
His heart, his talents and his hands were free
To all who truly needed aught of him.
Where poverty and ignorance were rife,
He gave his bounty as he gave his life.

The place and cause that first aroused his might
Still proved its pow'r until his latest day.
In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right
Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;
Wrong lived; His occupation was not gone.
He died in action with his armor on!

We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,
And felt the magic of his presence nigh,
The current that he sent thro'out the land,
The kindling spirit of his battle-cry
O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet
And place our banner where his hopes were set!

Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,
But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!
Thou'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar
And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.
She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,
She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,
And rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,
She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!",February,1908,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,"Sestain, Elegy",male,Frederick Douglass,Majors and Minors,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar

Men court not death
When there are sweets still left in life to taste.
Nor will a brave man choose to live when he,
Full deeply drunk of life, has reached the dregs,
And knows that now but bitterness remains.

Fears the false goblins of another life.

Black Samson of Brandywine,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"In the fight at Brandywine, Black Samson, a giant negro
armed with a scythe, sweeps his way thro' the red ranks""
--C. M. Skinner's ""Myths and Legends of Our Own Land.

Gray are the pages of record,
Dim are the volumes of eld;
Else had old Delaware told us
More that her history held.
Told us with pride in the story,
Honest and noble and fine,
More of the tale of my hero,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

Sing of your chiefs and your nobles,
Saxon and Celt and Gaul,
Breath of mine ever shall join you,
Highly I honor them all.
Give to them all of their glory,
But for this noble of mine,
Lend him a tithe of your tribute,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

There in the heat of the battle,
There in the stir of the fight,
Loomed he, an ebony giant,
Black as the pinions of night.
Swinging his scythe like a mower
Over a field of grain,
Needless the care of the gleaners,
Where he had passed amain.

Straight through the human harvest,
Cutting a bloody swath,
Woe to you, soldier of Briton!
Death is abroad in his path.
Flee from the scythe of the reaper,
Flee while the moment is thine,
None may with safety withstand him,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

Was he a freeman or bondman?
Was he a man or a thing?
What does it matter? His brav'ry
Renders him royal -- a king.
If he was only a chattel,
Honor the ransom may pay
Of the royal, the loyal black giant
Who fought for his country that day.

Noble and bright is the story,
Worthy the touch of the lyre,
Sculptor or poet should find it
Full of the stuff to inspire.
Beat it in brass and in copper,
Tell it in storied line,
So that the world may remember
Black Samson of Brandywine.

The innocent sports of our hearts that e'er bound us
   To memories now ivied with years,
The smile of that mother , so lovingly tender,
Her musical voice we ever remember
   The memory we sprinkle with tears.

Ah! yeş, on the tide of the outflowing years
Drift pleasures of youth , which our fancy endears ,
   On swells of this life's ocean foam;
And thoughts ' heavy storms are no longer before us ,
For rainbows of love strew brilliantly o'er us ,
   Those visions , enchanting, of home.

And flowers may bloom in the land where we dwell ,
And, living forever, in fragrance excel
   All others that e'er meet the eye,
And music's fond echoes may soothe us to rest ,
When warbled from birds in their leaf -cover'd nests ,
   And well from the heart a deep sigh.

But mem'ry entwining the pleasures now past ,
Will cling to them fondly - grow green to the last
   I care not the distance we roam ;
And perfume of flowers and birds music gather'd
But speak of the joys from which we are sever'd ;
   The sigh --- to return to our home.",January,1902,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,
The Heart's Desire,Robert W. Justice,Justice,"Float ever by me
In countless numbers,
Like waves in the mighty sea,
Strange faces of alien gaze,
Hurrying on to and from daily strife,
This way, and now that, yet all, all
Foreign, unfamiliar–still I stand and call 
In hushed breath, and wait for one
Who passeth by, never.
Yet I fear to leave my lonely place–
My watch-tower of delight where with me
Dwell Hope and Patience;
The one–sweet counseling voice–
Make days grow short, and I rejoice
When Patience laves my distressed soul
With reason and points to the goal
Where, though faint and dim,
I shall stand face to face,
And in love’s sweet embrace,
Fine and know My Heart's Desire.

And agile bodies sway, from side to side,

the jubilation of the jungle moon, laughing
with the stars; and the howl of the jackal

blended in concert all together.",June,1928,Saturday Evening Quill,Eugene Gordon,,male,"Music, Jazz",,,Predom. Black,
For the Shop Gal,S. Miller Johnson,Johnson,"She is a golden faery child.
     Her face is honey-colored, too.
She skips about her candy shop,
     While sunlight dances through
The door . . . . kissing my golden Sue.

She's everything the sun could wish,
     If form be everything.
If otherwise, then she's a fish;

Variations on a Black Theme,S. Miller Johnson,Johnson,"I have seen my little black Nellie gal-all naked!
She was wearing a beach-robe of black and 
     gold over one-piece bathing togs of 
blue and white.
She was strolling and singing and dancing 
     'long a silver sand-clad river bank.
Trimmed with budding cane and tiny-
     leafed drooping willows.

   I saw the tilt of her plump black breast
     Beneath that robe of black and gold
   Would its young beauty stand the test
     Of flames that brown lips hold?

I'd like to take her lithe dark body in my arms 
And gently squeeze from it
Rich juices of poetry and song.
For she's a slim gay gal with a heart and a song and a smile,
With a strut and a love for jazz!

As Nellie was singing and strolling and 
     dancing 'long that silver sand-clad river bank,
She didn't see me sitting over there behind 
     those drooping willows that waved by 
the silver river.
She didn't know I was feasting on the de-
     licious rhythm of her liquid movements….
And the sweet charm of her soft slim body– 
Dark as the depths of Bantu-land
And as near the teeming earth where God is.

Nellie thought she was out there by herself
… nobody peeping.
For she looked as free as the tall slim pines
     brushing bits of white clouds from the
sky on the other side of the silver
     river,
As she skipped along that silver beach,
Her little black feet sinking up to her danc-
     ing ankles in silver sand.

Nellie threw back her head and smiled at her lover, the Sun.
She stretched her snake-like body up towards mighty heavens
She relaxed with a sigh in the arms of the sun-glow.
Ah! thought I, with a thrill and a jump.
The dance to the Sun and the Silver River!

She flung off her robe of black and gold
And danced to the Sun and the Silver River
A dance primitive as the earth, mother of 
     gods.
She sang a song as she danced there in the 
     silver sand–
A song ripe with oldness and teeming with newness, 
     like the god-bearing earth,
'Neath pillared Angkor's mighty shades
     Her palm-like body sways in dance.
Now slow, now mad. The rhythm fades,
     Dissolves itself in air ... By chance
Her flowered tunic falls away,
     (The frantic dance goes on and on)
And shows her flesh in glad array
Adorned with gems from Askalon.
Nellie flung aside her suit of blue and white.
The Sun pretended to hide his face behind a
     little piece of white cloud.
But the sun was just fooling; he looked
     right through that veil of cloud at my
Nellie.
I got kind of jealous when the Sun looked
     at my Nellie with no clothes on.
Nellie danced on.
She shook herself,
Like a doe jumping up from good healthful
     sleep
In shaded woodlands
By singing rivulets
And maiden springs–
Springs that whine like a brown gal longing
     for loving.
Nellie kept singing and dancing,
Singing a song mellow with many years,
     and new,–
Like the great god-bearing earth:
She floats in honey-tinted sighs,
     She trips about on wings of song.
Desire beckons her with cries
     Of, ""Perfect happiness ere long!""
She's frankincense and myrrh, I ween.
     Her countenance is fair.
Her head the proudest ever seen
     Bedecked with silk-black hair.
Nellie's wild black hair fell loose,
Half veiling her beaming black face
Soft as finest chamois.
She lingered wantonly towards the edge of
     the silver water.
And placed her slender dark hands on her
     strong supple hips,
And gazed down upon her unclad self,
Her face aglow with mother-longing,
Like the mighty earth, mother of all the
     great gods of Black Folk.
With golden bracelets 'round her arm,
     A red rose in her hair,
Her soul is autumn-brown and warm.
     A poet's dream is living there.
Her darting, cutting, dashing eyes
     Half-closed, yet full of fire,
Ope wide, then close with mild surprise,
     To trap some some eager sire.
From side to side she swayed her comely hips,
Palm-like beneath the peeping giggling Sun.
Her step was firm, now weak, now pleading
To the Sun, her lover;
Now defiant, now ranting, now expressive of flight
Before her rival The Silver River.
The muscles of her swift black legs were taut,
Ready to run errands for her lover the Sun.
The soft curves of her neck,
The mellow outlines of her back
Flowed clearly . . . then confusedly,
As the dance got faster and faster.
I saw her dimpled knees, like smiling baby's cheeks.
I saw her tender breasts springing regularly,
Tipped with polished bronze,
Teeming with passion,
Pouting for love.
A drooping willow raised his drooping head
To feast his eyes on my Nellie dancing
     there naked on silver sand by the Silver
          River for her lover, the Sun.
I started to get kind of sore.
But I knew the old willow was too old to do any harm,
So I chanted:
     Do not disturb my very own.
     I'll let you stand afar and look
     At her whose soul is wine to me,
     A golden book, a soothing tone.
I saw her warm pert, laughing mouth.
I saw her right red lips
Magnetic, honey-clewed, half-parted,
Uncurtain the tips of her white, white teeth-
White like rice in a red-rimmed ebony bowl!
I saw her eyes smiling through her long black hair
Which hung all loose and lustrous in the Sun-glow.
I heard my Nellie say to her lover the Sun:
""Come love me now, come love me long.""
And I saw the Sun run off giggling behind the clouds.
Nellie shrugged her shoulders
And thrust her fists in her cynical ribs,
And leaned slightly forward,
And sang with the voice of a low-down hag
The song of the Black Fates:
""Dark gal born
Of a dark, dark woman
Ahey!
Sho' bound to see dark days.""
She plunged into the stream and swam against the tide,
While I gazed on, wrapt in celestial bliss, wild-eyed.",May,1927,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen, George S. Schuyler",Free Verse,male,"Eroticism, Dance",,New York,Predom. Black,

If I Had a Million ,S.A. Beadle,Beadle,"If I had a million dollars I don't know what I'd do,
But I sometimes think I'd stroll around and squander a few;
Or, maybe I'd steel away to the country's quietude
And spend the rest of life among the simple and the rude.

I harldy think with the fashionable I'd be imbued,
And the society woman I swear I would elude;
Nor should the bosoms 'of my Sunday shirts be immaculate-
Even a million, I don't think, my cranium would inflate.

Because I'd like to slip a cog. and go it with a bit,
With my soul aglow of passion for my brother in the pit ;
Proud to be with the commoners, I'd rusticate awhile,
Nor would I care a cursed thing about the latest style.

“Brogan shoes and homespun socks?"" The very things I need,
For too much dress and fashion would my lithe step impede;
A single gallus, friend, would hold my breeches on to me,
And I'd not care a snap about their bagging at the knee.

The doctrine of the broad-brimmed hat I'm sure I would not heed.
I believe in reducing things to what we really need;
Besides I've always been content under a brimless cap,
To go it with the urchins a-frolicing, jolly chap.

With them I'd like to take just now a little bit of ease,
A lounging where I used to, out under the apple trees,
A whittling and swapping jokes with Bill and Tom and Ned,
And let our mem'ries Ait around the lore of the trundle-bed.

Aye, over and above it all, this is the simple truth:
If I'd it, and could, I would spend a million for my youth!
Then with my true love I would go a sparking it again,
And look the love upon her my tongue could never explain.

To lead her once again, my friend, through the old Virginia reel :
To salute her, to balance all; again, to fondly feel
The same old bliss I used to while swinging corners all
And stepping to the music of the jocund country ball,

Were worth millions of yellow pelf to a maimed old chap like me,
And I'd give it, if I could, with a zest of childish glee.
Oh! if I could but put away my gout and rhumatis',
And take an old-time outing from the pressure of my ""biz,""

With a bonny girl and youth I'd go to the fair old sunny clime,
Down the sylvan haunts of Dixie, where the jessamines ever twine;
Where the lillies faint of sweetness, and ever blows the thyme;
Where the seasons all are summer and the climate is sublime !

Where the rose aflame of beauty, drops its petals on the sward,
Geraniums blush to scarlet; the passion flowers nod
And the breezy sweep of zephyrs brings on the metric chime
Of the winged minstrelsy in in the glory of their prime..

If you could take the silver from this old pate of mine,
Call back my youth a-gambling down yon vista way sublime,
And bring me back my true love, my long-lost love again,
Up from among the daisies where she so long hath lain ,

The million dollars you might have and millions o'er and o'er
Again I'd take my love and youth and ask for nothing more.",January,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,Male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alfred_Beadle
On the Commons of Brother John ,S.A. Beadle,Beatle,"My brother John has a cot of down
And a mansion for his home;
The humble bed where I rest my head
Is little less than a stone;
But love is there to soothe my care,
And brother John has pride,
So I pity him while I revel there,
For his is a world of care. 

My brother John has a fertile farm
Broad fields of cotton and corn,
Naught have I but the deep blue sky,
Just space to look upon,
And a barren spot behind his lot,
He assigns to me as home;
But I feel for John as I revel there
For his is a world of care.

My brother John's lord of a town,
While I not a hovel own;
Without a home the world I roam,
A happier man than John.
I know not why that John and
I Have drifted so far apart,
And I feel for him, my brother there;
For his is a world of care.

My brother's hold is fixed on gold,
A carriage and horses four;
And they draw their load over the paved road
With a flash and a dash by the poor.
When go I must, I tramp through dust
Alone where they have sped,
Yet I feel for John as I revel there;
For his is a world of care.

My brother John has a splendid lawn,
Scythed and rolled and green,
A verdured spot of which I'm not
Even allowed to dream,
To all that pass, “Keep off the grass,""
Is the order, and I keep on,

Putting all her toys away ,
Climbing eager to my knee .
Presses tender lips to mine ,
Nestles fondly on my breast ;

Curses Father Missouri, impotently shakes 
His fist at the forecloser, the treacherous skinflint,

And leaves puddles in his parlor, and useless lakes 
In his fine pasture land. 
Sees years of work turned to nothing—

When de Saints Go Ma'ching Home,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"He'd play, after the bawdy songs and blues,
After the weary plaints
Of “Trouble, Trouble deep down in muh soul,”
Always one song in which he'd lose the role
Of entertainer to the boys. He'd say
“My mother’s favorite.” And we knew
That what was coming was his chant of saints
“When de Saints go ma’chin home
And that would end his concert for the day.

Carefully as an old maid over needlework,
Oh, as some black deacon, over his Bible, lovingly,
He'd tune up specially for this. There'd be
No chatter now, no patting of the feet.
After a few slow chords, knelling and sweet
Oh when de saints go ma’chin home
Oh when de sayaints goa ma'chin home
He would forget
The quieted bunch, his dimming cigarette
Stuck into a splintered edge of the guitar.
Sorrow deep hidden in his voice, a far
And soft light in his strange brown eyes;
Alone with his masterchords, his memories. . .
   Lawd I wanna be one in nummer
   When de saints go ma’chin home.
Deep the bass would rumble while the treble, scattered high
For all the world like heavy feet a trompin’ toward the sky.
With shrillvoiced women getting ‘happy’
All to celestial tunes.
The chap’s few speeches helped me understand
The reason why he gazed so fixedly
Upon the burnished strings.
For he would see
A gorgeous procession to ‘de Beulah Land’
Of Saints—his friends—‘a climbin’ fo’ deir wings.’
Oh when de saints go ma’chin home
Lawd I wanna be one o’ dat nummer
When de saints goa ma’chin home...

Mammy
With deep religion defeating the grief
Life piled so closely about her
Ise so glad trouble doan last ‘alway’
And her dogged belief
That some fine day
She'd go a machin
When de saints go ma'chin home.
He sees her ma’chin home, ma’chin along,
Her perky joy shining in her furrowed face,
Her weak and quavering voice singing her song—
The best chair set apart for her worn out body
In that restful place . . .
I pray to de Lawd I'll meet her
When de saints go ma’chin home.

He'd shuffle off from us, always, at that,
His face a brown study beneath his torn brimmed hat
His broad shoulders slouching, his old box strung
Around his neck;—he’d go where we
Never could follow him—to Sophie probably,
Or to his dances--in old Tinbridge flat.

After the Storm,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"There is pathetic beauty in it all;
       O’erhead the murky, sullen rainclouds pass,
       The sun’s first darting rays have pierced the mass,
Just now so grim, so gray. Again the call
Is heard of storm-hushed robins. Maples-tall,
       To show the regal silver of their class,
       Rustle their thirst-slaked leaves and on the grass,
Drenched into higher colog, some last drops fall.

’Tis like that heart, whose happiness excelled
       All others, which, with its gay threshold crossed
            At last by sorrow’s gloom, has fitly learned
To stifle throes of pain, has ne’er rebelled
             In angry bitterness, has merely turned
Gayness to pathos, with no beauty lost.

Lincoln,T. Thomas Fortune,Fortune,"The waves dashed high; the thunders echoed far;
The lightnings flashed into the dismal gloom
The bolts by Vulcan forged in Nature's womb,
And earth was shaken by the furious war!
The Ship of State was strained in every spar!
And strong men felt that now had come their doom;
And weak men scanned the dark heavens for a star
To save them from a fratricidal tomb.
But, one, amid the strife—collected, calm,
Patient and resolute—was firm, and trod
The deck, defiant of the angry storm,
Guiding the ship—like to some ancient god!

With every vict'ry that is won

Whose song was sweet and bold, whose face was black,
Who audience ahd not evolved, alack!

The swin has had a pearl. How few the eyes
That followed him when on that horse's back
he reared up throug the air that has no track,
To where non but Apollo's darlings rise.
He sang and ""loved and lost,"" but nevermore
Will such sad themes be his; for at the gate
Of sweet Elysium he'll learn a song

Three Poems,Thomas Millard Henry,Henry,"The Song of Psyche

Hark this message I bring, in this carol I sing,
From a song that I heard in the park.
'Twasn't trammelled in word, for it came from a bird;
'Twas divined from the notes of a lark

Dreams Are the Workman's Friends

Dreams are the workman's friends. Their rapture can
Awake his spirits better than old wines ;
To 'waken him to beauty is their plan;
They bring him rubies from remote confines.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

I daily hang my latchstrings out of doors
For them. They throw conditions to the winds.
They find me lighting lamps or tinting floors;
And yet they greet me like old-fashioned friends.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

Forsooth, the elves of limbo leave my camp,
They jostle in confusion in retreat.
My rapture drives them onward like a lamp
Drives on the dark before the pilgrim's feet.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

They bring me mingled rapture o'er the crest,
That once behind horizons hid away.
Their gift of rapture burns within my breast
Like twilight beams that love the dying day.
   Dreams are the workman's friends. 

My Motive

Should you who listen to my flute
Conclude 'twere best if I were mute,
Or should you doubt that I have won
The wreath of praise, the glad ""well done"";

For though I limitations feel.

Constrained by reverence, not conceit —

To a Scientist,Thomas Millard Henry,Henry,"I saw the sunset yesterday
Behind the gold and purple west.
My soul's a richer soul for aye,
Because upon my heart was pressed
Its dream-inspiring souvenir.
Last June when roses were in bloom,
I saw one rare one in the dew.
My heart beats faster, I presume,
Because it was so simply new —
So supra-sweet its atmosphere.
I hear men praying to behold
Some far-off glory, and to share
Some city built of finest gold;
But why should I have business there,
If it be lovelier than here?
If I'm too crude to entertain
The joy that's made for me on earth.
Would not you think me basely vain
To build a bridge across its worth
In search of something lovelier?
And I can count them by the score, —
Those beauties that have touched my life.
The souls untouched by them are poor;
And they will help you in the strife
Who are our civic pioneer.",October,1923,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,

   When all the birds were singing in the air,
   And Nature was her loveliest , and fair:
Oh ! it was sweet, too sweet to end so soon.

Song of the Smoke,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"I am the Smoke King
I am black!
I am swinging in the sky,
I am wringing worlds awry;
I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
I am the soul of the soul-toil kills,
Wraith of the ripple of trading rills;
Up I’m curling from the sod,
I am whirling home to God;
I am the Smoke King
I am black.

I am the Smoke King,
I am black!
I am wreathing broken hearts,
I am sheathing love’s light darts;
Inspiration of iron times
Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes—
Lurid lowering ’mid the blue,
Torrid towering toward the true,
I am the Smoke King,
I am black.

I am the Smoke King,
I am black!
I am darkening with song,
I am hearkening to wrong!
I will be black as blackness can—
The blacker the mantle, the mightier the man!
For blackness was ancient ere whiteness began.
I am daubing God in night,
I am swabbing Hell in white:
I am the Smoke King
I am black.

I am the Smoke King
I am black!
I am cursing ruddy morn,
I am hearsing hearts unborn:
Souls unto me are as stars in a night,
I whiten my black men—I blacken my white!
What’s the hue of a hide to a man in his might?
Hail! great, gritty, grimy hands—
Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!
I am the Smoke King

Easter-Emancipation 1863-1913/ Children of the Moon,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"I am dead;
Yet somehow, somewhere,
In Time's weird contradiction, I 
May tell of that dread deed, wherewith
I brought to Children of the Moon 
Freedom and vast salvation.

I was a woman born
And trod that streaming street
That ebbs and flows from Harlem's hills
Thro' caves and canyons limned in light
Down to the twisting sea.

That night of nights
I stood alone and at the End
Until the sudden highway to the Moon,
Golden in splendor,
Became too real to doubt.

Dimly I set foot upon the air;
I fled, I flew, thro' thrills of light,
With all about, above, below the whirring
Of almighty wings. I found a twilight land
Where, hardly hid, the sun
Sent softly saddened rays of
Red and brown to burn the iron earth
And bathe the snow-white peaks
In mighty splendor.

Black were the men,
Hard haired and silent slow,
Moving as shadows
Bending with face of fear to earthward;
And women there were none.

""Woman, woman, woman!""
I cried in mounting terror.
""Woman and Child!""
And the cry sang back
Thro' Heaven with the
Whirring of almighty wings.

Wings, wings, endless wings,
Heaven and earth are wings;
Wings that flutter, furl and fold,
Always folding and unfolding,
Ever folding yet again;
Wings, veiling some vast
And veiled face,
In blazing blackness,
Behind the folding and unfolding,
The rolling and unrolling of
Almighty wings!

I saw the black men huddle
Fumed in fear, falling face downward;
Vainly I clutched and clawed,
Dumbly they cringed and cowered,
Moaning in mournful monotone:
   O Freedom, O Freedom,
   O Freedom over me;
   Before I'll be a slave
   I'll be buried in my grave
   And go home to my God
   And be free.

It was as angel music
From the dead,
And ever, as they sang,
The winged Thing of wings, filling all Heaven,
Folding and unfolding, and folding yet again,
Tore out their blood and entrails
'Til I screamed in utter terror
And a silence came:
A silence and the wailing of a babe

Then at last I saw and shamed;
I knew how these dumb dark and dusky things
Had given blood and life
To fend the caves of underground
The great black caves of utter night
Where earth lay full of mothers
And their babes.

Little children sobbing in darkness.
Little children crying in silent pain.
Little mothers rocking and groping and struggling,
Digging and delving and groveling
Amid the dying-dead and dead-in-life.
And drip and dripping of warm, wet blood
Far, far beneath the wings.
The folding and unfolding of almighty wings.

I bent with tears and pitying hands
Above these dusky star-eyed children.
Crinkly haired, with sweet-sad baby voices
Pleading low for light and love and living— And I crooned:

   Little children weeping there,
   God shall find thy faces fair;
   Guerdon for thy deep distress.
   He shall send His tenderness;
   For the tripping of thy feet
   Make a mystic music sweet
   In the darkness of thy hair;
   Light and laughter in the air—
   Little children weeping there.
   God shall find thy faces fair!

I strode above the stricken bleeding men.
The rampart 'ranged against the skies.
And shouted:
""Up I say, build and slay;
Fight face foremost, force a way,
Unloose, unfetter and unbind;
Be men and free.""

Dumbly they shrank
Muttering they pointed toward that peak
Than vastness vaster,
Whereon a darkness brooded,
""Who shall look and live,"" they sighed;
And I sensed
The folding and unfolding of almighty wings

Yet did we build of iron, bricks and blood;
We built a day, a year, a thousand years.
Blood was the mortar,blood and tears
And, ah, the Thing, the Thing of wings,
The winged folding wing of Things,
Did furnish much mad mortar
For that tower.

Slow and ever slower rose the towering task
And with it rose the sun.
Until at last on one wild day,
Wind-whirled, cloud-swept and terrible.
I stood beneath the burning shadow
Of the peak.
Beneath the whirring of almighty wings
While downward from my feet
Streamed the long line of dusky faces
And the wail of little children sobbing under
Earth.

""Freedom! "" I cried.
""Freedom! "" cried Heaven, Earth and Stars,
And a Voice near-far
Amid the folding and unfolding of Almighty wings
Answered ""I am Freedom—
Who sees my face is free—
He and his.""

I dared not look;
Downward I glanced on deep bowed heads and closed eyes,
Outward I gazed on flecked and flaming blue—
But ever onward, upward flew
The sobbing of small voices;
Down, down, far down into the night.

Slowly I lifted livid limbs aloft;
Upward I strove:
The Face, the Face ;
Onward I reeled:
The Face, the Face!
To Beauty wonderful as sudden death
Or horror horrible as endless life—
Up! Up! the blood-built way
(Shadow grow vaster!
Terror come faster!)
Up ! Up to the blazing blackness
Of one veiled face
And endless folding and unfolding,
Rolling and unrolling of Almighty wings:
The last step stood!
The last dim cry of pain
Fluttered across the stars—
And then—

Wings, wings, triumphant wings,
Lifting and lowering, waxing and waning,
Swinging and swaying, twirling and whirling,
Whispering and screaming, streaming and gleaming,
Spreading and sweeping and shading and flaming—
Wings, wings, eternal wings,
'Til the hot red blood Flood fleeing flood,
Thundered thro' Heaven and mine ears
While all across a purple sky
The last vast pinion
Trembled to unfold.

I rose upon the Mountain of the Moon;
I felt the blazing glory of the Sun.
I heard the Song of Children crying ""Free!""
I saw the Face of Freedom—
And I died.

Joseph Pulitzer,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"Softly, quite softly—
For I hear, above the murmur of the sea,
Faint and far-fallen footsteps, as of One
Who comes from out beyond the endless ends of Time,
With voice that downwar d looms thro' singing stars;
Its subtle sound I see thro' these long - darkened eyes,
I hear the Light He bringeth on his hands—
Almight  Death! Softly, oh, softly, lest he pass me by,
And that unquivering Light toward which my longing soul
And tortured body through these years have writhed,
Fade to the dun darkness of my days.

Softly, full softly, let me rise and greet
The strong, low luting of that long - awaited call;
Swiftly be all my good and going gone,
And this vast veiled and vanquished vigor of my soul
Seek somehow otherwhere its rest and goal,
Where endless spaces stretch,
Where endless time doth moan,
Where endless light doth pour
Thro ' the black kingdoms of eternal death.

Then haply I may see what things I have not seen,
Then I may know what things I have not known;
Then may I do my dreams!
Farewell! No sound of idle mourning let there be
To shudder this full silence—save the voice
Of children—little children, white and black,
Whispering the deeds I tried to do for them;
While I at last unguided and alone
Pass—softly, full softly.

Above the dream-swept poppy's mouth,
Athwart the black and crimson South--
Why dost thou fear--why dos thou fear? 

Lo! sense its sleep-sown subtle breath,
Where wheel in passioned whirl above
All lingering, luring love of love--
All perfume born of dole and deaht.

Cold ghost-wreathed Lily of the North,
When once thy dawning darkens there,
Come then with sunlight-sifted hair
And seek the haunting heaven of Night.

In phantasy to dream and die--

Child of the Night,Walter Everett Hawkins,Hawkins,"Child of the Night am I-
Night's sable son;
When the elf-children came,
   Lo! I was one.

Darkness was over me when I was born,
I court the night-spirits and scoff at the morn,
Rainbows of midnight my features adorn.
   At the great forge of Time,
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
   Ere light was born.

   Poised on the wings of Night,
      Upward I glide,
   Flouting the flings of light,
      Proudly I ride.

I rest on the pillows of thunderous clouds,
Arrayed in the billows of wondrous shrouds,
I whip up the lightnings and mock the pale crowds.

   At the great forge of Time,
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
      Ere light was born.
   Blessing the sable sons,
      Lifting their shroud,
   Pressing less able ones,
      Purging the proud.

I daub them with ebony, smother their pride,
I swab them with smoke and their vanity chide.
Is the soul of a man in the hue of his hide?

   At the great forge of Time
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
      Ere light was born.
   Child of the dusky veil,
      Kissed by the Sun,
   Girded in trusty mail,
      Truth bids me on.

Cloud me in battle smoke, night-shrouds attend me,
The beginning was blackness and so will the end be;
Black God and black angels, surround and defend me!

     The temples of Isis and Osiris,
     The Alphabet

     I am the Sphinx and the Pyramids,

     I give food to the tables of monarchs, 
     My coal warms the palaces of princes,
     My diamonds deck the bosoms of queens,—
     The queens in the palaces of London,
     The salons of Brussels and of Paris,
     The salons of Berlin
 
I am Africa:
     On the fertile banks of the Congo
     My sorrow in song I have lifted;
     In the cane brakes and cornfields of Texas
     My sorrow songs still I am singing,
     I sleep ’neath the stars in the jungle,
     I am brother to the beasts and the leopard,
     The lion’s strength moves in my sinews,
     In my bones is the iron of my Africa.
     I worship the life-giving sunlight,
     Oblations I give to the moon,
     My gods are of stone and of iron—
     No greater than these have I found.
     I build temples which I may not enter,
     I garner the harvest but eat not;
     I gather the cotton in the Southland,—
     Give grist to the mills in the Northland,—

I am Africa:
     I laid down my life at Fort Pillow,
     My blood’s on the Common of Boston;
     I died on the flag at Fort Wagner,
     My bones lie bleaching in Flanders. 
     They lynch me and burn me in Georgia,
     My body is fuel in Texas,
     They jim-crow me even in Washington, 
     They mock me even from the White House.
     Black as the wealth of my coal mines, 
     Black as high noon of my midnight,—
     I am the nimbus of nations,
I am Africa.

Ethiopian Maid,Walter Everette Hawkins,Hawkins,"I MINGLE my goblet with oil of the vine,
And drink to the health of a maid most benign;
No less do I drink to her beauty and youth,
Than to her meek innocence, virtue and truth;
And meekly arrayed in thy modest brocade,
I drink to thy health, Ethiopian maid.
'Mid noon-tide and moon-tide whatever my themes,
Thy vision creeps in the enchantments of dreams;
The pipings of skylarks and trills of the wren
Are mixed in the midst of the melody when
Thy laughter rings out in the vine scented glade,
As I drink to thy health, Ethiopian maid.
When sun of the tropics turns westward and dies,
The magic still lingers in light of thine eyes;
I mingle my goblet with oil of the palm,
Where spices hang over and summer smiles warm,
And there, 'mid the magic of forest and shade,
I drink thy sweet health, Ethiopian maid.

The Death Bed,Waring Cuney,Cuney,"All the time they were praying
He watched the shadow of a tree
Flicker on the wall.
There is no need of prayer,
He said,
No need at all.
The kin-folk thought it strange
That he should ask them from a dying bed.
But they left all in a row
And it seemed to ease him
To see them go.
There were some who kept on praying
In a room across the hall
And some who listened to the breeze
That made the shadows waver
On the wall.
He tried his nerve
On a song he knew
And made an empty note
That might have come,
From a bird's harsh throat.

That they were in there praying

We hear the voice of all the sages :

In My Garden,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Today 'tis sunny June, the breeze is soft
   And pauses sweetly dying where I sit,
Here in my dear old garden where aloft
   The tuneful birds about me sing and flit.

And here today no longing breaks my calm .
  No mad desire fraught with ceaseless strife ,
For roses, lilies, aloe-balls have balm
   To sooth away the harsher thoughts of life.

This is the place to doze and sink to dreams
   As all the while the roses bud and bloom,
And sweet birds warble, and the murmuring streams.
   And honeyed bees blend in harmonious tune.

So here today this fresh green June is sweet,
   And in my garden dreaming o'er and o'er
I drowse beneath its perfume and its heat
   And fill my heart full of sweet nature's lore. ",June,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite

Holly Berry and Mistletoe: Lyrics,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"I.
THE trees are bare, wild flies the snow,
   Hearths are glowing, hearts are merry —
High in the air is the Mistletoe,
   Over the door is the Holly Berry.
Never have care how the winds may blow,
   Never confess the revel grows weary —
Yule is the time of the Mistletoe,
   Yule is the time of the Holly Berry.
II. 
Come trip a measure,
Let the heart be gay,
Yule grants a pleasure
None can say us nay.
Let the song be merry ,
Be it fast or slow
Hope is in the Holly -Berry,
And Love in the Mistletoe .
Of the year, the sadness
'Tis we rememberNow is time for gladness
Here in December .
High may drift the snow ,
Winds may lift and carry—
But Love comes with the Mistletoe ,
And Hope with the Holly -Berry.
III.
What makes the house so quiet today ?
Children , you really must go and play .
This is the time for holly and joys,-
Here, my pets , are your books and toys .
See , papa will blow your new horn , Ned
And shall he read a tale from your book, Fred?
And baby can rattle here on my knee
No? Won't take to my terms for a spree?
Mary, my little woman, my dear,
Come ... child be brave , brush away that tear
...Oh God ! my darlings how can we be gay,
And this, Mother's first Christmas away!
IV. 
A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East ,
And o'er a city shone, where men were gay with wine and feast ;
Shawms were sounded , and maidens made the lutes sweet with song,
And a cry for the King went forth from the heart of the throng .
Dancers performed for the guests with jewelled ankles and ears ,
And the riotous deep applause went forth sounding the doom of years.
A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East !
And shone on two who walked away from the noise of the feast .
On the hill-side the weary two , to a stable made their way ,
To share with kine the chilly place till comes the break of day .
The woman dreamed in her sleep that night , woke in pain and smiled
The dream was but the light of a Star, the coo of a little child .
V. 
December comes , snows come ,
   Comes the wintry weather ;
Faces from away come
   Hearts , must be together .
      Down the stair - steps of the hours
      Yule leaps the hills and towers-
--Fill the bowl and hang the holly,
   Let the times be jolly.
Day comes , and night comes
   And the guests assemble
Once again the old dream comes
   That I would dissemble.
      Falls a shadow 'cross the floor ,
       Seen !-and is seen no more.
O that mem'ry would forego
   The hanging of the Mistletoe .",December,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,Lyrics of Love and Laughter,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
Two on the Cliffs,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Two on the cliffs by the purple sea,
With the waves unbound and the sea -winds free;
Wound in the mesh of its sobbing tone.
And the tangling swirl of the sun-kissed foam .
Two hand in hand by the glad, old sea,
With but one sweet dream for you and me.

The sea's soft sigh on reef and shore,
Two hearts keep rythm for ever more,
Blue of the sea and the sky are one,
And two hearts beating in unison.
O rhyme of the ages, sweep of the sea,
And two souls thrall'd in its mystery.",September,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
A Little World,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Dear one, when we are wed in happy bliss,
   When cares and heart -aches from our lives are gone ,
No bitter strife will stoop our souls to kiss
   For peace from mated love will then be born .

A little world made up of you and I—
   We two a whole creation , soul and heart ,
Where I will be as sun in June's soft sky ,
   And thou the moon , our world's serener part .

And in our world of love will be no drouth ;
   The hours will be as flowers , fair and sweet ;
Kissed ever by soft breezes from the south
   Low-winnowed with bird songs for lovers meet .",September,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
Easter Day,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Today I woke and looked upon the heath
   And odorous breath
Of lilies, and the sweet geranium,
   With the low hum

Of birds, spoke softly to my ears and said :
   ""He who was dead
Lives once again — He rose 'twixt day and night
   In samite white.

And all the morn grew flush'd in subtle bloom;
   All death's sad gloom
Vanished; and joy, as when His foot touched earth
   Sprang into birth.""

Then one did seem to stand in field nearby,
   And loudly cry:
""Step blithely midst the flow'rs, for I am He
   Of Calvary.

And when thou, too, hast borne thy cross thro' life,
   And won the strife ,
Like me, shalt thou emerge from death and rise
   With this great prize:

""Life's raiment cleansed with precious blood of mine;
   And radiant shine
Beside my Father's throne, three lilies in thine hair,
   As crown shalt wear.""",April,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
Thanksgiving,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"My heart gives thanks for many things—
   For strength to labor day by day,
For sleep that comes when darkness wings
   With evening up the eastern way.
I give deep thanks that I'm at peace
   With kith and kin and neighbors, too;
Dear Lord, for all last year's increase,
   That helped me strive and hope and do.

My heart gives thanks for many things;
   I know not how to name them all.
My soul is free from frets and stings,
   My mind from creed and doctrine's thrall.
For sun and stars, for flowers and streams,
   For work and hope and rest and play,
For empty moments given to dreams—
   For these my heart gives thanks today.

Yes, Lord, my thanks for many things
   But one thing thou hast given ,is best ---
I thank thee for the song it sings,
   I thank thee for its golden crest.
Of all the gifts to man on earth
   Love is the best, the good, the great:
My soul has given a dream, love-birth:
   I thank thee for the happy state.",November,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,"Lyrics of Love and Laughter, Dunbar Speaker and Entertainer",Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
To Beatrice,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"The tender notes of Philomel
   Heard far in the star -lit woods ,
Are not so sweetly audible
   As the music of thy moods .
The hue of the woodland lily
   By the verge of the forest pool ,
Glows not with such chaste, sweet beauty
   As thy pure and gracious soul.

As the nightingale sings of the rose,
   So my heart sings ofthee
As the moon in the garden glows
   So glows thy soul to me.
As heart to heart inclines
   When Love's sweet skies are blue,
So Beatrice, my soul divines
That my love is all for you!",September,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite
The Vision,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"The Vision
By William Stanley Braithwaite

(McClure's Magazine for June.)

You are the vision, you are the image of the dream,
The voice among the stars, the silence in the stream;
A breath of the infinite poise, where space and time are spun,
And the circling orbits wheel their planets round the sun.
Beyond the outer margin where nothing calls to God
Leaps the fiery symbol to bloom wherever your feet have trod;
Here is the earth resurgent with color and bloom of spring,
Glorying the dream and the vision of the song you bring.

Age and Autumn,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Where now is the blaze that hung intense
      Through summer days?
Transmuted into another sense
      By slanting rays?
Is it your keel, O Earth, with a turn sublime
       Which changes Time
And makes the sunshine weary and mellow
And the flowers wither, and green leaves yellow?
And man, is he a flower—or a green leaf
      Whose flourish is brief?
Old Earth, sailing so even and quiet.
      Stilling the riot
In the blood of youth, is yours the blame?—
      Or does Time play your game?
Are you one. or twain, that makes autumn weather
In the body of man, or do you work in the sere together?",October,1926,Palms,Countee Cullen,,male,,,"Guadalajara, Mexico",Predom. White,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite#:~:text=William%20Stanley%20Beaumont%20Braithwaite%20(December,in%20the%20early%2020th%20century."
Laughing it Out,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"He had a whim, and laughted it out
   Upon the exit of a chance;
He floundered in a sea of doubt--
   If life was real--or just romance.

Sometimes upon his brow would come
   A little pucker of defiance;
He totalled in a word the sum
   If life was real--or just romance.

And then a hearty laugh would break,
   A reasoning shrug of shoulder;
And we would from his fancy take
   A faith in death which made life bolder.

Scintilla,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"I kissed a kiss in youth
   Upon a dead man's brow;
And that was long ago,--
   And I'm a grown man now.

It's lain there in the dust,
   Thirty years and more;--
My lips that set a light
   At a dead man's door.

The After Thought,Willis Richardson,Richardson,"Oh that last night I said I did not care,
But I was fretful from an angry sting;
And in my petulance was unaware 
Of what great change a few hours' thought would bring.
Now you are gone, my days are bleak and long
And vacant as a sail-deserted sea;
Silent is my poor heart's divinest song,
Dead all those dreams of hope that lived with me.

For a Rose,Yetta Kay Stoddard,Stoddard,"Rose of the dusk, my musk rose,
Perfumed bloom of fire and dream and dew,
Singing, I'm bringing the quietude of night to you.

God's hand and my hand
Enfold you and hold you close. Repose
In His care and my prayer. Fair, you understand?

Journey's End ,Zora Neale Hurston,Hurston,"Ah! let me rest, when I have done,
Beneath a warming, stirring sun,
Beneath a flower-studded sod
That shows the smiling face of God.
In kindly earth that comfort gave,
A kindly couch where dreams the brave,
Where longing hurries weeping grief,
where halting goes the gilded chief.
Sweet spring will trail a bridal veil,
Grim frost shall lose his howl and wail,
And summer flowers deck my breast 
And sunlight gild me from the west.
But I shall rise with verdant spring,
And I shall speak when song-birds sing, 
And laughing ripple in the streams,
And flit and flicker on the beams.
Ah! let me rest when I have done.
When I my earthly course have run,
And wake me not to shame or blame,
Nor stir my dust with flore of flame. ",April,1922,Negro World,,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston#:~:text=Zora%20Neale%20Hurston%20(January%207,on%20hoodoo%20and%20Caribbean%20Vodou."
Night ,Zora Neale Hurston,Hurston,"When night opens her shining eyes
   And spreads her velvet gown,
She softly paints the purple skies
   In grays of cloudy down. ",April,1922,Negro World,,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston#:~:text=Zora%20Neale%20Hurston%20(January%207,on%20hoodoo%20and%20Caribbean%20Vodou."
Passion ,Zora Neale Hurston,Hurston,"When I look back 
On days already lived
I am content.
For I have laughed 
With the dew of morn,
The calm of night;
With the dawn of youth
And spring's bright days.
Mid-summer's bloom 
And autumn's ripening glory
My youth rejoiced. 
And when winter bleak
Spread melancholy 'round
I still smiled on.
And I have loved
With quivering arms that
Clung, and throbbing breast--
With all the white-hot blood
Of mating's flaming urge.
My cool, white soul
Has oft fared forth
In Astral ways,
for none may lag
When star dust hides the earth.
The wing of dreams 
Have swept me up
To touch my feed on cloud
And wander where none
But souls dare climb. ",April,1922,Negro World,,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston#:~:text=Zora%20Neale%20Hurston%20(January%207,on%20hoodoo%20and%20Caribbean%20Vodou."
Reveries ,Zora Neale Hurston,Hurston,"Whence come I to this world of stife,
This sphere of love, this vale of sighs?
What called me to this form of life,
This street of truth, this trough of lies?
Where shall I go when I have done?
Will nothingness my soul then claim?
Must naught come of the struggles won?
Shall I be called to praise or blame?
But, let me question as I will,
Enthralling silence answers me.
My whence is hidden to me still,
My hence is wrapped in mystery.",April,1922,Negro World,,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston#:~:text=Zora%20Neale%20Hurston%20(January%207,on%20hoodoo%20and%20Caribbean%20Vodou."
