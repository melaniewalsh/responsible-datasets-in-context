New Wars,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"HURL on the lance! Break up the ancient peace!
Now let the arrow hiss in air and sing;
Now let the spear-point on the armor ring;
Sound forth the call to wars that never cease!

Ye hoot the yellow Mongol from your land;
But forth to regions all his own ye go
To reap the riches of his overflow,
And just ye call the working of your hand!

Now see the scramble of the Christian host--
Them all press forward for the spoil that's won;
New wars! new wars! ris'n on the olden one--
And this, this the enlightened freeman's boast!

But greater is the strife than here would seem,
And wider realms embracing than the East,
For that is but the remnant of the feast.
I had a vision. (Was it all a dream?)

The weary Titan groaned beneath the weight
Of nations growing weaker day by day,
Whose men he deemed but men of minor clay,
And destinies he wrought for them their fate.

And why, methought, does not the giant's creed
Cast off the weaklings that would warp his might,
And leave alone the wretches in their plight?
No answer save ""I would not"" from his greed.

So freedom hails th' advance of king and queen;
The march of mind goes on o'er field and flood;
Republics curb the weak with shows of blood;
And lordly priests profess the Nazarene!

Yet hear the trumpet and the cannon's roar,
The orphan's crying and the widow's wail;
But what of them? Unfurl the sail! flay! flail!
On! on! on to the mighty breach once more!

A Picture,Olivia Ward Bush-Banks,Bush-Banks,"I drew a picture long ago —
A picture of a sullen sea;
A picture that I value now
Because it clears Life’s mystery.
My sea was dark and full of gloom;
I painted rocks of sombre hue.
My sky alone bespoke of light,
And that I painted palest blue.
But e’en across my sky of blue
Stretched troubled clouds of sodden gray,
Through which the sun shone weak and dim,
With only here and there a ray.
Around my rocks the yellow foam
Seemed surging, moaning in despair
As if the waves, their fury spent,
Left naught but desolation there.
Three crafts with fluttering sails I drew,
And one sailed near the rocks of gray,
The other on its westward course,
Went speeding out of danger’s way.
The other still outdistanced them
Where sky and water seemed to meet.
I painted that with sails full set,
And then my picture was complete.
My life was like the sullen sea,
Misfortune’s woes, my rocks of gray;
The crafts portrayed Life’s changing scenes,
The clouded sky Life’s troubled Day
I long to paint that picture o’er,
Without the rocks of sombre hue;
Without the troubled clouds of gray,
I’ll paint the sky of brightest blue.
My sea shall lay in calm repose,
No hint of surging, moaning sigh.
My crafts, unhindered by the rocks,
Shall speed in joyous swiftness by.
But this will be when brightest hours
Of hope and cheer are given me.
I’ll paint this picture when Life’s sun
Shines clear upon Prosperity.",June,1900,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,female,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Ward_Bush-Banks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Christmas Reunion,Augustus M. Hodges,Hodges,"Twas a bright Christmas morning in ""Ole Kentuck"";
Aunt Sallie was busy disrobing a duck-
A featherless turkey close by her side lay,
Prepared for the dinner that bright Christmas day.
'Twas a family reunion, and Uncle Joe Moore
And his good wife Aunt Sallie, both ten and threescore,
Had gathered around them their ""girls"" and their ""boys,""
With these ""children's"" children - the grandparents' joys.
The ""girls"" (all past thirty) were helping to make
The ""sweet tater puddin's,"" the pies, and the cake;
The ""boys"" and the grand-boys the fires were making,
The oldest granddaughter the biscuits was baking,
The little grandchildren a dozen or more
Were tumbling about just outside of the door;
While Uncle Joe Moore, the venerable sire,
Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire.
When the clock tolled the midday the feast was complete,
And after each member had taken his seat,
The venerable sire rose up from his chair,
And with uplifted arms he offered this prayer:
""We thank Thee, our Father in heaven,"" he said,
""For the abundance of good things before us now spread;
We thank Thee, dear Lord, that I and my wife
Have been spared by thy goodness to reach an old life;
We thank Thee, of all things, the sweetest and best,
For our dear children's presence from North, South and West.
Continue Thy blessings, Thy goodness, Thy love,
And prepare us to meet Thee in heaven above.""
The grace being over the feast was begun.
The duck and the turkey were carved one by one;
The big chicken pot-pie received the same fate,
And a generous helping was piled on each plate.
After the meats came the puddings and pies;
Then how the grandchildren all opened their eyes
When one of their uncles from far Illinois
Brought out from the closet a basket of toys.
As dinner was over, the venerable sire
Rose up from his seat and stood by the fire,
Where he called to his side each lamb of his fold,
And blessed and caressed them like Jacob of old.
""What changes we've seen, Sal,"" remarked Uncle Joe,
""These years we've been married, some forty or so.
Now let me see, forty? Yes, forty-one years
Today, since we met at Uncle Bill Steer's.
I remember, ole 'oman, you looked mighty gran',
And I was then, children, er good-lookin' man.
I walked with your mother from Clayton that night,
And 'fore we got home, why I got in a fight.
Tom Scott, a 'patroller,' insulted your mother,
So I knocked him down, and Ed, his big brother.
I then asked your mother if she'd be my wife.
Her answer was: 'Yes, Joe, since you risked your life
For me up the road, and licked old Tom Scott,
Yes, I'll be your wife; why, Joseph, why not?'
But the next day, my children, my master sold me
To an ole Nigger trader' from East Tennessee,
Where I worked on a farm without seeing your mother
For eighty long days, till me and another.
Plantation hand run away and met with good luck,
For we soon found ourselves on the soil of Kentuck.
'Fore my ole master knowed I run erway
We two was married that same Christmas day.
We was married at Scottsville by ole Peter Brown,
Who was a white minister that lived in the town,
And would marry us slave folks no matter or not
If our masters was willing, if we only had got
A couple of chickens or a barrel of corn.
The very next Christmas our Lucy was born,
And the next of the past that I now can remember
Is when we moved here the following September.
Then came the war, Sal, and ole marster died,
While Missus and you, Sal, stood by his side.
Then I left you and children, and went out to fight
For the Union and Freedom one warm summer's night.
Then good Abr'am Lincoln, he sot us all free,
And we had in the county a big jubilee.
Then you boys and you girls all worked hand to hand
To buy me and your mother this house and this land.
Then some of you married, and some went out West,
While me and your mother, along with the rest,
Stayed on the old homestead and worked night and day,
A farming and trucking, and made the work pay.
We are glad for to meet you all back here once more,
And see your dear babies together, before

Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire.
Me and your mother (we are both old and gray)
Receive old Death's summons to call us away.
God bless you, my children, through life, is my prayer,""
And the venerable sire sat down in his chair.
The rest of the evening was passed in a measure
Receiving old friends or by chatting in pleasure
Till long after midnight, with hearts light and gay.
'Twas a happy reunion that bright Christmas day.",December,1900,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,Slavery,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_M._Hodges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Memorial of Frederick Douglass,C. Henry Holmes,Holmes,"He was a noble hero, born in an humble state,
But with a will like Nero, his cruel chains did break.
If in the glorious transept, worth and fitness reign,
If in the unknown regions, all are rewarded the same,
If to the hero modern, honor is rightly given,
His is a sapphired crown in the bright kingdom of heaven.
Tell of sagacious raids on the black tiller of soil,
Bringing from under-byways
Into freedom's sunshine and joy.
Tell of the noble plea the companion of martyred John Brown,
Earth but records - heaven rewards
The worthy with worthy renown.
Tell of the noble traits of character true as steel,
Tell of the fear-fraught days which every true patriot feels.
Tell of the powerful mind that forces the just decree,
Fair Ethiope placed with thee her hopes in blessed security.
Wet are the cheeks of millions; loudly do they lament,
Whence thou art swiftly riven from the mundane transient.
Death- unsatiable devourer thou checkmate of good men's
deeds,
-
Visiting earth each hour, unmindful of worldly needs,
But to thy name and prestige, posterity ever lauds,
Honor in life, happy in death, near the throne of the living God.

The Negro's Worth,Alonzo Milton Skrine,Skrine,"Who casts a slur on Negro worth, a stain on Negro fame?
Who dreads to own his Negro blood, or hear his Negro name?
Who scorns the warmth of Negro hearts [illegible] the clasp of Negro hands?
If he but shows his traitor's face, we [illegible] him where he stands.

The Negro's hands! Ah, lift them up. made strong by honest toil.
The champion of the Civil War and of the Cuban soil:
Their battle swords they flash aloft, though death in front they see ;
The Negro's hands did valiant deeds tot brave Cuba free.

They bore the old flag bravely, and were there at Lincoln's call.
They stood beside the foremost rank, with the bravest of them all.
And when before the enemy's guns they held the Gray at bay —
O never could the Afric heart beat prouder than that day.

So if some proud Caucasian cavils at the darkness of your race,
Or speaks in scorn of Africa before her children's face,
Then lay aside the flag of truce, and denounce him where he stands 
For Negro's worth and Negro's fame were won by Negro's hands.

Neath the Crown and Maple Leaf,A.R. Abbott,Abbott,"A SIGH is breathed from million heart.

Nor asks his hue or kind.

""On Britain's sacred soul the slay
In chains shall never tread""

""Soon as the bondman's weary feet
Shall press its holy crust.

In free and blest manhood,
Revere the name of England's Queen:

Childhood's Memory,Violette Neatly Blackwell,Blackwell,"It was a dream, a dream of happiness,
A dream of love, so filled with melody ,
I scarce could breathe for its intensity :
It was a dream that only girlhood dreams.

It came upon me in the month of June,
   When all the birds were singing in the air,
   And Nature was her loveliest , and fair:
Oh ! it was sweet, too sweet to end so soon.

I'm older now and wiser, and my dreams,
   Those winged messengers of thoughts,
   Are not so youthful, nor so folly fraught:
They now are dreams that only women dream.",December,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,female,,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Neatley_Anderson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Holly Berry and Mistletoe: Lyrics,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"I.
THE trees are bare, wild flies the snow,
   Hearths are glowing, hearts are merry —
High in the air is the Mistletoe,
   Over the door is the Holly Berry.
Never have care how the winds may blow,
   Never confess the revel grows weary —
Yule is the time of the Mistletoe,
   Yule is the time of the Holly Berry.
II. 
Come trip a measure,
Let the heart be gay,
Yule grants a pleasure
None can say us nay.
Let the song be merry ,
Be it fast or slow
Hope is in the Holly -Berry,
And Love in the Mistletoe .
Of the year, the sadness
'Tis we rememberNow is time for gladness
Here in December .
High may drift the snow ,
Winds may lift and carry—
But Love comes with the Mistletoe ,
And Hope with the Holly -Berry.
III.
What makes the house so quiet today ?
Children , you really must go and play .
This is the time for holly and joys,-
Here, my pets , are your books and toys .
See , papa will blow your new horn , Ned
And shall he read a tale from your book, Fred?
And baby can rattle here on my knee
No? Won't take to my terms for a spree?
Mary, my little woman, my dear,
Come ... child be brave , brush away that tear
...Oh God ! my darlings how can we be gay,
And this, Mother's first Christmas away!
IV. 
A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East ,
And o'er a city shone, where men were gay with wine and feast ;
Shawms were sounded , and maidens made the lutes sweet with song,
And a cry for the King went forth from the heart of the throng .
Dancers performed for the guests with jewelled ankles and ears ,
And the riotous deep applause went forth sounding the doom of years.
A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East !
And shone on two who walked away from the noise of the feast .
On the hill-side the weary two , to a stable made their way ,
To share with kine the chilly place till comes the break of day .
The woman dreamed in her sleep that night , woke in pain and smiled
The dream was but the light of a Star, the coo of a little child .
V. 
December comes , snows come ,
   Comes the wintry weather ;
Faces from away come
   Hearts , must be together .
      Down the stair - steps of the hours
      Yule leaps the hills and towers-
--Fill the bowl and hang the holly,
   Let the times be jolly.
Day comes , and night comes
   And the guests assemble
Once again the old dream comes
   That I would dissemble.
      Falls a shadow 'cross the floor ,
       Seen !-and is seen no more.
O that mem'ry would forego
   The hanging of the Mistletoe .",December,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,Lyrics of Love and Laughter,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Braithwaite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanksgiving,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"My heart gives thanks for many things—
   For strength to labor day by day,
For sleep that comes when darkness wings
   With evening up the eastern way.
I give deep thanks that I'm at peace
   With kith and kin and neighbors, too;
Dear Lord, for all last year's increase,
   That helped me strive and hope and do.

My heart gives thanks for many things;
   I know not how to name them all.
My soul is free from frets and stings,
   My mind from creed and doctrine's thrall.
For sun and stars, for flowers and streams,
   For work and hope and rest and play,
For empty moments given to dreams—
   For these my heart gives thanks today.

Yes, Lord, my thanks for many things
   But one thing thou hast given ,is best ---
I thank thee for the song it sings,
   I thank thee for its golden crest.
Of all the gifts to man on earth
   Love is the best, the good, the great:

In My Garden,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Today 'tis sunny June, the breeze is soft
   And pauses sweetly dying where I sit,
Here in my dear old garden where aloft
   The tuneful birds about me sing and flit.

And here today no longing breaks my calm .
  No mad desire fraught with ceaseless strife ,
For roses, lilies, aloe-balls have balm
   To sooth away the harsher thoughts of life.

This is the place to doze and sink to dreams
   As all the while the roses bud and bloom,
And sweet birds warble, and the murmuring streams.
   And honeyed bees blend in harmonious tune.

So here today this fresh green June is sweet,
   And in my garden dreaming o'er and o'er
I drowse beneath its perfume and its heat

Two hand in hand by the glad, old sea,
With but one sweet dream for you and me.

The sea's soft sigh on reef and shore,

Vanished; and joy, as when His foot touched earth

The Snapping of the Bow,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I dreamed a dream, and, in my dream, I heard
One wail at midnight by a convent's walls.
And, as he wailed, he clutched the stars, and shook
The pillars of the firmament of God,
And rolled the thunders of Olympus down
On men; and they besought their holy ones
To plead with him ---lest he might spoil the world.

   His face was bronze; his limbs were bronze but steel;
His mane was blacker than the Steeds of Night.
And his great eyes flashed warnings from beneath
A citadel where daring thoughts abode.
A comely youth---why needed he to weep?

     Alas! upon his brow he wore the brand
Of degradation, and upon his neck
A circlet galling as a crime!--And from
The cursed thing a chain of hate e'er bound
Him where he stood. His hands were manacled;
His limbs wore thongs that cut the flesh agape,
Until, for the pure pain, he writhed and wept,---
As weeps a conquered god-the prisoner of Despair!
He flung himself upon his knees, and burst into a prayer:

      ""O God, and hast
Thou made me for these miseries? I feel
Myself a man ---I have the spirit and
The hopes of one. O, why, then, must I strive
And fail?---No lake is clearer than my soul;
No ship is prouder; none more tempest tost.
'Tis true my brow is dark; but, in the night,
My spirit walks the stars, and lightly spurns.
Its kinship to this world!---Lord, I have tried;

A phantom of the silent sphinx---the grim,
Spell-casting thought of some deep master dead.

Halted his band, and spoke in tones of awe.—

The Gift of the Greatest God,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"It was in the magic city, in Apollo's temple there,—
'Mid scenes of brilliant splendor , and enchanting beauty rare;
'Mid domes and spires and minarets ; lakes, groves, and flowers and streams ,
And music sweet as singing in the City of Our Dreams!
Thus set, Apollo's temple stood , as fair to mortal eyes
As the palace of Aladdin in a land of paradise!
And in its walls the president a levee held that day,
To greet a grateful people o'er whose hearts his love held sway.

Crowned by the law's majestic power , and guarded by its might ,
The president stood smiling on the people , left and right ;
And giving, with a stately grace, a friendly clasp of hand
To any who might reach him -tho ' the humblest in the land .
To a mighty organ's pealings , the procession moved along—
Merchant and sturdy toiler mingling in the countless throng ;
Proud dames and merry working girls- high, low; the young and fair
The black and white , and many born in other lands were there .

But, look you! Yonder comes Czolgosz, the strippling , with bound hand ,
To strike , with serpent's venom, the chief ruler of the land!
He has planned the deed with cunning , and will execute it soon----
Write, with inky black of Hades, “Murder "" on the sky of noon!
He would bathe the thrones of earth in blood -abolish law and love ;
Thwart commerce ; ruin church and home-tear God from Heaven above ;
Give lust free rein and crime a throne -set shame and terror free,
And light, with burning homes , the mad, red hell of Anarchy !

The president had stopped to kiss a pretty little child ,
And pat its head ; then on the throng again he looked and smiled ;
Now came the baby's mother ; next , Parker, the Negro , there ;-
And when Czolgosz , and---two quick shots rang sharply on the air.
You know the story: How the wounded president sank down ;
And how brave Parker leaped and bore the assassin to the ground .
I read it all, and, tho ' my tears fell ere I ceased to read,
My heart beat higher as it told of Parker's noble deed!

That night I dreamed the scene again : Anon methought a change
Transfigured all ---The moonlight filled the room with beauty strange ,
While ,thro ' an open doorway , surged the people ,wave on wave ,
To greet the ebon hero who had done a deed so brave .
From every section of the land the grateful people came
To load this mighty Son of Ham with trophies of his fame .
And from far distant countries, in my dream it seemed to me,
Came king and czar and emperor this fearless man to see .

This was not all : Methought the shades of the immortal dead
In shadow forms , moved softly with the concourse , haply led
By pity for the struggling Race of Man to lend their aid.
In this dread hour . They came in robes of light and mist arrayed :
There Moses , Plato , Shakespeare, Burns, John Brown and Douglass stood,
August of mien , and grand of brow, in beauteous brotherhood ,-
Some with the light of ages garlanded, but all aglow
With holy glory , looming grand and god -like here below .

""What shall we give this Negro,"" cried the populace , as one-
""How fittingly reward him for the deed that he hath done ? ""
Answered Kaiser William quickly , "" In the Rhine -land , such as he
Are knighted ; honored ; landed ; loved and feted royally !""
Quoth Edward-—“ In old England , wrong is wrong and right is right ;
And, were he there, we'd treat him like a Briton- black or white!""
Then the Czar said : “To my Russia let this noble black be sent ,
Where to Pouskin, our black poet, we have reared a monument .""

Then Douglass said to Plato : ""What said I of my race?
Said I not the world judged wrongly, when it judged by hue of face ?
Aye ! there are more noble in my race than there 'er were knaves or brutes ,
And they, like trees uncultured , may not yield their choicest fruits .""
""Thou 't right,"" said Plato, nobly ; ""he hath proved himself a man!----
Diogenes would name him so, could he his features scan .""
And Moses said : ""Amen! Amen!---I am made only men,
As Burns hath sung ."" And John Brown said : ""I'd die for such again!""

""What shall thy gift be, Parker?"" asked a man with blanching cheek .
A Negro mother with her babe cried : ""Speak ! In God's name , speak !""
Then Parker said : “O, hear me ! This is my request I make ;
And grant it, not for me alone ; but for my people's sake .
Set us free to go as workers in the wide fields of the Lord !
We ask no special favors ; labor brings its own reward !
Strike the social chains from off us ; let us be as men 'mongst men—
And we'll do you deeds as noble as are writ with human pen!

""We do not ask for seats around the white man's fireside ,
But for opportunities to work in fields to us denied—
A chance to toil with willing hands at work God made us for,
And not to do that which we hate, with self and God at war !
We want to live as free men ; not as half slaves 'mong the free,
With free men's rights and homes in this fair Land of Liberty !
'Tis not to enter white men's homes, but to enjoy our own
In the land for which our fathers died-the only we have known!”

A consternation fell upon the throng , both young and old ,
As Parker's voice rang thro ' the hall in accents loud and bold .
And 't was declared impossible to grant request so rash .
""You tried to save our Chief, "" one said. ""What will you take in cash?""
But Parker said : ""Can it not be?"" And Plato cried , ""For shame!""
And Moses rent his robes , and wailed : "" It offendeth God's high name!""
And Douglass wept, and John Brown's face grew stern, as wroth with man,
As he heard his people cry : ""Alas ! we can't; and who - who can?”

But , at that moment, in the door , a wondrous form appeared ,
And , as he clove the parting throng , the Immortals softly cheered .
""It is the dauntless future,"" Plato cried , ""the Mightiest!---
Who loveth mortals , and is , of Immortals , first and best !""
The future stood majestic . Calm his brow was ; in his speech
The awe and music of the waves that kiss the pebbly beach ;
His face leonine , but fair ; and he spake , as the room grew still ,
""Tho ' ye think ye may not do so much, I can, I swear , and---will!""",December,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,Patriotism,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Corrothers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skeetin' On De Ice,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"At a little country meeting in a log house near the road,
   The saints had duly gathered ""fur de worshup ub de Lord;""
When ""Bru Levi send de pulpit"" cleared his throat, and then began
   ""De spoundin' ub de scripshur, fur to cheer de spet'ual man.
I was a teacher in the county and was in duty bound
   In attendance on the services, to help the brethren 'long;
Brother Levi was the pastor, and dispensed the gospel here
   As he misunderstood it at twenty-five a year.
The day was warm and sultry, sleep was getting in my eyes,
   When this most unique sermon filled me with intense surprise;
""My belubbed congregashun, I bin preachin' 'bout de possle,
   An' tock my tex' whar Paul poked his 'pistle at de Romans.""
""But to-day I gwine to tell you 'bout de chillua ub de Lord,
   When dey crossed de ragin' waters at de spokin ub de word.
I kno' ya'll lung bin wondrin' how de chillun crossed de sea,
   But tiz jes ez plan ez kin be, to er' spienced man like me.""
""You see twus in de winter an' de water all wuz frez,

Now ya'll see de thing wuz simple, an' likewise very nic',
   Fur all de chillun had to do, wuz to skeet across on ice.""
""But when ole Farro kum long wid dem hebby chayut wheels,
   De ice jes gin away an' ole Farro had to frez.""
This was hard on my intelligence as the teaching of the school,
   So I had to rise and say a word, although against the rule.
""Beg pardon, brother pastor, but geographies you know
   Say this land is in the tropics where can be no ice or snow.
""I thanks you dough I does not like no sturbmence on dis topic,
   But in dem days 'twont no gogerfies, so cours dar wont no tropics.”
Of course I was dumbfounded, the brethren said “amen,”
   An thus he then concluded ere I could speak again,
When you gwine to cross de water you better take advice,
   An' 'cep'n de Lord am wid you, don't skeet across on ice.”",April,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,Common Measure,male,"AAVE, Religion",Idle Moments (1895),Boston,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/daniel-webster-davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Rose,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"This rose of the garden is given to me,
And to double its value 'twas given by thee;
And its beautiful tints to my eyesight is borne,
Like a kiss of a fairy, or blush of the morn.
How sweet the aroma that is wafted to me,
Let the scent of the breeze of the isles of the sea;
And it tells of the care of that Father above,
Who sends us the flowers to tell of his love.
But too soon must this sweet-scented flower decay,
Its bright leaves must wither, its scent die away,
But its memory lingers and the joys that it bore,
Will remain with me fondly, when the flower's no more.
Fond hopes too may perish, their leaves fade and die,
And great expectations all withered may lie;
But He who has loved us and given his Son,
Sets a sweet bow of promise and bids us hope on.
May our friendship ne'er perish, its strength ne'er decay,
But may it grow stronger and stronger each day;
And may the All Father his love o'er us bend,
Till life's journey's completed, and heaven the end.",April,1901,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,Religion,Idle Moments (1895),Boston,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/daniel-webster-davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nor why my hopes so soon are dust,

When darkest clouds my sky o'er hang,
   And sadness seems to fill the land,
I calmly trust His promise sweet,
   And cling to his ne'er failing hand,
And, in life's darkest hour, I'll just
      Look up and trust.
I know my life with Him is safe,
   And all things still must work for good
To those who love and serve our God,
   And lean on Him as children should,
Though hopes decay and turn to dust,

Jes' Gib Him One Ub Mine,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"A little urchin, ragged, black, an old cigar ""stump"" found,
And visions of a jolly smoke began to hover 'round,
When finding that he had no match, a big store he espied,
And straightway for it made a bolt, to have his wants supplied.

""We have none here to give away; and even if we do,
We have no match,"" the owner said, ""for such a thing as you.""
Down in the ragged pantaloons the little black hand went,
And forth it came, now grasping tight a big, old-fashioned cent.

""Gib me a box!"" the urchin said,---his bosom swelled with joy,
And calmly lighted his ""cigar,"" a radiant, happy boy;
Then handing back the box, he said, while his face with pride did shine,
""Nex' time a genl'mun wants a match, jes' gib him one ub mine.""",March,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,male,AAVE,,Boston,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/daniel-webster-davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  All the night through, though I moan in the dark,
  I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.

  Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves,
  Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves.
  But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky,
  I shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry;
  And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved through the dark,
  I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.

  On the high hills of heaven, some morning to be,
  Where the rain shall not grieve thro' the leaves of the tree,
  There my heart will be glad for the pain I have known,
  For my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own;
  And though life has been hard and death's pathway been dark,

Unwritten History,John Riley Dungee,Dungee,"MINE is the humble duty and endeavor to relate
A point of information that the hist'rics don't narrate.
Of our country's cause and conflicts, and the progress she has made
They tell us, but are silent on the part the Negro played.

We weren't at the discovery of this delightful land,
But throughout its development is seen our humble hand .
We felled the forests hewed the way for emigration's tide;
We reaped the grain and hoed the fields of cane and cotton wide.

We led the first resistance against the despot's sway,
When from our land he sought to take her liberties away.
We fought throughout the conflict with unselfish resolution,
And, vict'ry won, our suffrage helped to frame the Constitution.

'Twas not our fault our valor and devotion were forgotten;
'Twas not our choice that we were made the victims of King Cotton;
Unwillingly we were the cause, unfortunate, that rent
The Union we would willingly have suffered to cement.

Though our consent was not required, yet do we claim the merit
Of multiplying hoards of wealth for others to inherit.
Were half the country's lands and goods converted into gold,
'Twould not exceed the revenue for which our labor sold.

Our constant care and faithfulness were levied to provide
Comfort and case for those by whom our freedom was denied.
We tended them in infancy, in sickness and in age,
No want of theirs, nor whim, that failed our service to engage.

And when dread palpitation shook the nation's troubled heart,
'Twas our peculiar destiny to play a triple part.
While thousands fought their chains to break, some wrought to weld them faster;
Others remained the home on guard to aid and succor master.

With internecine clouds o'erblown, and peace again returned,---
And amity and happiness with our assistance carned,
Our service and our sacrifice we've failed not to devote,
Our country's cause to honor and her glory to promote.

Then wherefore do our virtues all escape the public eye?
Wherefore our imperfections do they seek to magnify?
How can our land, our native land, her treachery excuse?
The merit of our loyalty, how long will she refuse?

Of all the blood her freedom cost the Negro shed the first;
Of all whom freedom ought to bless the Negro fares the worst.
She never can repair the loss of what she took away;
The debt of gratitude she owes she never can repay.

The Mother's Question,Augustus M. Hodges,Hodges,"As visions of the past, by memory led,
From every opening vista crowd the mind,
Till all our present duties fade---have fled,
And Time rolls back to years far, far behind;
If, by some strange enchantment we could be
Then winged from matrons, back again to youth,
Would we return once more to girlhood's glee
Would we return? I ask. Pray, speak the truth!
      Would you return?

Would you recall to earth, from peaceful sleep .
Fond parents; have them break their heavenly rest,
To toil again, to watch, to mourn, to weep
O'er cares and troubles, only you know best?
Would you return to fleeting youth again,
And hush the prattle in your baby's cot
Aft' all these years of care, of toil, of pain?

In Dreamland,Augustus M. Hodges,Hodges,"I OWN estate with shady bowers,
Enthroned upon a tropic isle,
With fragrant plants and fruits and flowers;
Heaven and nature's sweetest smile
Beams brightly on this vast domain;
A princely mansion, large and bright,
A host of servants in my train,
Who do my bidding day and night —
In Dreamland.

Only wait the lovely morrow:

   Look around, behold the bright,
And will find how many blessings
   Have been hidden from our sight.
Neither sorrowing nor complaining,

Hear his loving message saying:

Rest at last in Heaven -- our Home. ",January,1901,Colored American ,Walter W. Wallace,,female,,,Boston,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Home,Robert Hamilton,Hamilton,"How charm'd is the car by this one, simple word!
It quickens the pulse, though so often tis heard,
   When fortune compels us to roam ;
The buds of true promise will blossom anew ,
Becoming more fragrant with memory's dew,
   When hearing the lov'd name of home.

Our childhood's fond joys, with our kindred around us,
The innocent sports of our hearts that e'er bound us
   To memories now ivied with years,
The smile of that mother , so lovingly tender,
Her musical voice we ever remember
   The memory we sprinkle with tears.

Ah! yeş, on the tide of the outflowing years
Drift pleasures of youth , which our fancy endears ,
   On swells of this life's ocean foam;
And thoughts ' heavy storms are no longer before us ,
For rainbows of love strew brilliantly o'er us ,
   Those visions , enchanting, of home.

And flowers may bloom in the land where we dwell ,
And, living forever, in fragrance excel
   All others that e'er meet the eye,
And music's fond echoes may soothe us to rest ,
When warbled from birds in their leaf -cover'd nests ,
   And well from the heart a deep sigh.

But mem'ry entwining the pleasures now past ,
Will cling to them fondly - grow green to the last
   I care not the distance we roam ;
And perfume of flowers and birds music gather'd
But speak of the joys from which we are sever'd ;
   The sigh --- to return to our home.",January,1902,Colored American,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Latter-Day Eden,Colonel Charles Young,Young,"It was a twentieth century eden, mine ;
A modern Adam, I; and for my Eve ,
God gave a winsome woman with senses fine
Who deemed the cloth -of-life of golden weave.
'Mid trees whereon hung riches, pleasur, glory,
Again thro ' eden's garden went we twain,
Care -free and gay as when in ancient story
The first fair Eve with Adam led the train
Of all the living down the vernal vales,
And threaded sun-flecked shadowed paths of paradise;
Or rested at the noon in those sweet - scented bowers
In trustful love, while drinking from each other's eyes
Mutual content and joy and happiness for hours .
The feast with plenty flower -crowned,
   Sweet music's most enchanting strain,
Dance with her deft and measured round ,
      And lays
         Of poet-praise
Were ours: and counted not as vain .
   Ah, eden days indeed ! days of delight
   That melted into golden mist at night !
We drank from selfish satisfaction's cup,
         Content , and toyed
With life's ideals . Drank the dregs (ah, sorry sup!)
         O fsin and cloyed.
Riches, success, soft ease , and luxury
Were our cup-bearers round our bounteous board ,
Disguised devil -gods, who from the tree
Of life made their wit-stealing wine and poured
For us a heaven-forbidden draught and smiled
While merriment amused and sense beguiled .
Then fled the joy, alack ! that filled the heart!
Saddened companions, see, we sit apart!
Oh, day of wrath ! alas, the fateful hour!
O'er all our eden blew a blighting wind
Stifling and sickening spirit , bird and flower ;
Sapping our souls , for we had sinned!—had sinned!
Dark sorrow's dismal night enwrapped us round,
Our once calm bosoms were despair's abode:
No balm for the soul's healing could be found!
Close by our bower the wraiths of unrest rode,
Unbridled fears were loosed , remorse was calling
From the dim distance ne'er-agains appalling .
I knew that naught in me with this fell state could cope,
So led my sickened love into the house of hope.
         And there ---ah, there:
         Gloom and despair!
   Clad in th' habiliments of woe,
      How helpless hope is lying,
   Her lamp of life is burning low,
      Her attendant sisters dying :
   Faith fainting , finds , alas ! too late
      Friendship's best bonds are interest,
   And gray -robed death she doth await,
      His coming deems a welcome guest.
   Love lifts her eyes to heaven in prayer
      While her brightest stars are paling ;
   But a gleam of blessing finds she there
      The earth's a place of wailing;
   ""Tho' the arms that clasped her yesterday
      When all the world was green and bright
   Are loosed and gone for aye -for aye ,
      Slinking away beneath the night .
Then pointed love aloft, her eyes in sorrowing gaze,
We heard an angel -voice from out a golden haze,
Say soft in accents soothing , gracious , kind ---
Delicious as sweet -scented south-land wind:
""Ah , man ! ah, woman ! for each wasted year
May you atone, God says !-But 'tis not here.
Forth from your eden ! Leave illusion land,
Go to the struggling poor , weep round the bier ,
The lowly lift and dry misfortune's tear !
Of every race, each is your brother man:
Try what your loving ministrations can.
Encourage him, remove oppression's heel ,
And with each daily doing learn to feel .
Work , man ! work, woman , without recompense ,
Nor expectant of reward or grateful sense!
Work for the land's uplifting , for the right :
For work alone leads back again to light.

The Nativity,T. Bolden Steward,Steward,"A child is born; all in the Earth and Sky
Chorus unending song at this great birth.
The heavens are gorgeous with the holy glow
Of the resplendent light; a herald star
To the Wise Men (first pilgrims to his shrine),
Loosed from the star -gemmed archway that impends
Over God's golden throne, shot grandly thro'
The firmament, and in crescendent brightness glowed
When all its spell divine was spent, above
His birthplace lowly.

In snow-white robes and breathing o'er the earth
Celestial odors, God sent messengers
Fluting glad Seraph -notes of joy to those
Late-watching shepherds; diffused a soothing light
About their path; and in angelic strains
The cherubim adore the Infinite.
The shepherds view the manger - cradled Child;
Above the Heavens join their notes serene,--
And countless tribes of men hear that love-theme,
Divinely beautiful.

On the Child's brow divinely radiant gleams
The love-lit crown of Eden innocence:
And Seraphim, majestic, beautiful,
His courts attend; in choruses divine
A choir invisible, through earth and sky
Hymns to the warring sin -cursed Universe,
Anthem of joyous praise, announcing Peace,
Glory to God, and His good-will toward men.

Now Ocean, Earth and Sky
Echo the Seraph song; the caves of Hell
Groan back dull dirges of impending woe
And fell defeat; while a choronal choir
Of God's Archangels and Heaven's scraphs sings,
""Lo! here the gift of God, comes down to men,
The King of Earth, the Saviour of Mankind.
Let blood-redeemed mankind welcome their King,
Their Shepherd who from Calvary's Cross shall lead
Frail sin-sick souls all sinless, back to that
First Eden of their Father and their God.

Christmas Thoughts,Mrs. H. M. Reid,Reid,"I was sitting by the are,
On a cold, cold wintery might,
Listening to the children's prattle
In their joy and their delight.
Of the foremost thought within them,
""Santa Claus will soon be here,
We can hear his sleigh-bells jingle
Just the same as tho' he's near.""

Then my heart grew sad for others,
Many, many miles away,
Father, mother, sister, brother,
Thinking that same thought today.
But their Christmas will be poorly,
Not as bright as ours around,
Yet they kneel and thank their Saviour.
That he loves and does not frown
Upon little country children.
Just because they're not in town.

In my fancy now I see them,
Feeding, milking, hauling corn;
Then when night comes, getting ready
Sack and gun, and hounds and horn
They will go and hunt the ""possum,""
Alfred, John and Mr. Mc,
And I think I hear them shouting,
H-o-o-p! when Driver's on the track.

""Light the lantern, Leed has treed one,
Hear him bark!"" they shout with glee,
And LeRoy climbs up the Red Oak,
Shakes the ""possum"" from the tree.
""Here he is: and he's a big one:
Oh what luck! Ah, let me see;
Listen, boys, they've treed another,
I hear Ponto; hurry he!""

Aloa takes the sack of ""possums ""
(When they've caught some two or three),
James will blow the horn for doggies;
Here comes Driver, Ponto, Leed.
Now they turn their footsteps homeward,
Calling grandpa, sleeping sound;
""Clean our game tomorrow morning,
Grandma, cook them nice and brown.""

""How we wished Hagar was with us,
But she don't eat ""possum"" tho',
Yet she would enjoy the hunting
Of the cunning fellow, so.""
This is how they spend their Christmas
Many, many miles away,
In the woods among the blackjacks,
Hauling feed, corn, fodder, hay.

Could they hear the Christmas carol,
Could they hear the church-bells, then,
Could they hear the choir singing,
""Peace On Earth Good Will Towards Men"",
Would they long to leave the country?
Would they pine for life afar?
Would they give up all their pleasure? 
Just to come here where we are?
No; they'd rather hunt the ""possum,""
Feed their horses just at dawn,
Than to hear the Christmas carol,
Than to live in crowded town.

Father Time,Effie D. Threet,Threet ,"All blessings on thee, Father Time,
Thou art the theme of prose and rhyme.
Oh, let me now thy praises sing,
For Time, thou art a mighty king!

Thy golden scepter sways o'er all,
Before thee kingdoms rise and fall;
Still never weary on thy way
Thou ploddeth on from day to day.

By thy command comes lovely Spring,
The flowers bloom and sweet birds sing,
And while all nature seems in tune,
We see the rosy face of June.

Oh! how delightful is the scene,
When earth is all arrayed in green;
Bedecked with Summer roses rare,
Sweet pinks and waving lilies fair!

Say, Father Time, now pause a while,
And let us bask in Summer's smile;
And linger 'neath her cooling shade,
'Oh why should Summer roses fade?'

But no! Once more thy scepter sways,
And now come on September days;
Earth's verdant robe is changed to gold
The flowers fade—the year grows old.

Thou moveth on with steady tread,
November's snowflakes brush thy head;
Around thee blows the chilling blast,
And now the old year breathes its last.

Yes, Father Time, thou art a king,
And well of thee let poets sing,
For thou dost hold a rightful sway,
And thy commands we must obey.

The rosy cheek, the sparkling eye,
Before thee slowly fade and die
The strong man droops, his strength decays,
And o'er him pass thy fleeting days.

By thy command loved ones must part
The eye grows dim and sad the heart.
Then to the soul bowed down with grief,
Thy soothing balm brings sure relief.

Still ever on thy ages run,
What others dare not, thou hast done.
Well might thy praises tune this rhyme,
Oh Prince of Rulers, Father Time!

March on! Thou king, March on thy way!
Still o'er us let thy scepter sway,
And bring us to that golden shore
Where friends and loved ones part no more.

The Battleground,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"Let me live close to men's hearts. In the years
When youth is full, let me know men and grow
Into the knowledge of their pulsing souls.
Not on some distant height wherein the veil
Fame tapers and the siren temples blaze,
May my days pass, but on a lower ground,
Where men of might brave dubious circumstance,
Where sorrow wears the heart, would lose the soul,
Where earnest life demands the high ideals. 
In lusty labor and the fight with fire,
Or sin, unlovable benightedness,
May I know men, and knowing learn to love,
And loving learn to help them in their toil.

The Psalm of a Race,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Earth hath not one trampled mortal
Whom an all-wise Maker gave
Sense and reason but to foretell
Him created a mere slave.

Races differ; but are equal.
Since the flight of Time began,
Each hath been some other's sequel
In the forward march of Man.

Oh, my brothers better favored
In this ""Land of Liberty,""
Sorrow all the winds hath flavored
'Cross the gulf 'tween thee and me!

Must the answer be forever
To our hopes, as it hath been,
""Never, never, never, NEVER""?-
Oh, the doleful repeten'!

O my soul, what fears assail it
When that chilling word is said!--
""Never!"" Oh, the night-winds wail it
In their requiem o'er the dead!

""Never""!--foaming waters sob it
To the wrecks along the shore:—-
""Never""!--All the sad drums throb it.
Marching to the battle's roar!

Say it not. Bar not, nor blight us:
Send, from summits where ye dwell,
Hopes, like torches, that may light us
From the labyrinths of hell.

And, my comrade, do not waver,
Tho' you be of trampled race,
Claim your birth-right, without favor,
""Till the world shall give you place.

Rise on visions sent to win you
From your languor and duress;
By the hope that lives within you,
God hath called you to success.

O, if looms Life's mount before you,
Towering terrible and vast;
Threatening loud to topple o'er you,
Muttering warnings of the past;

Do not tremble when you near it,
To behold its awful height;
Like the eagle, let thy spirit
Soar above it, in its flight! 

Rills of joy flow down that mountain,
Gems of beauty cluster there;
Thou canst quaff there of life's fountain,
And breathe triumph in the air!

And when thou hast scaled the highest
Peak in all that mountain-band,
Help the comrade toiling highest
Mount it from the table-land.

God is just; and, with his own hand,
He will shape our destiny;
If our future be in this land,
Or in that beyond the sea.

Be it ours to watch and listen;
Calmly ours to meditate;
Brighter stars will rise and glisten,
Tho' their coming seemeth late.

I Can Trust,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"I can not see why trials come,
   And sorrows follow thick and fast;
I can not fathom His designs,
   Nor why my pleasures can not last,
Nor why my hopes so soon are dust;

When darkest clouds my sky o'erhang,
   And sadness seems to fill the land,
I calmly trust his promise sweet,
   And cling to his ne'erfailing hand,
And in life's darkest hour I'll just
          Look up and trust.

I know my life with him is safe,
   And all things still must work for good
To those who love and serve our God,
   And lean on him as children should.
Though hopes decay and turn to dust,
          I still will trust.

Truth,Frances E.W. Harper,Harper,"A rock for ages stern and high,
Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky;
And never bowed his haughty crest,
When angry storms around him prest

Morn springing from the arms of night,
Had often bathed his brow with light;
And kissed the shadows from his face,
With gentle love and tender grace.

Day, pausing at the gates of rest.
Smiled on him from the distant west,
And from her throne the dark-browed night
Threw 'round his path her softest light.

And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
Nor love, nor wrath his spirit bowed
He bared his brow to every blast,
And scorned the tempest as it passed.

One day a tiny, humble seed,
The quickest eye would hardly heed
Fell trembling at that stern rock's base,
And found a lowly hiding-place.

A ray of light and drop of dew
Came with a message kind and true
They told her of the world so bright,
Its love, its joy, and rosy light;

And lured her from her hiding-place,
To gaze upon earth's glorious face;
So peeping, timid, from the ground,
She clasped the ancient rock around;

And climbing up with childish grace
She held him with a close embrace
Her clinging was a thing of dread,
Where'er she touched a fissure spread;

And he who'd breasted many a storm,
Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
So truth, dropped in the silent earth,
May seem a thing of little worth
Till, spreading 'round some mighty wrong,
It saps its pillars proud and strong.

Poem,Hilary Teague,Teague,"Land of the mighty Dead!
Here Science once display'd,
   And Art, their charms;
Here awful Pharaohs sway'd
Great nations who obey'd;
Here distant monarchs laid
   Their vanquish'd arms.

They hold us in survey-- 
They cheer us on our way
   They loud proclaim,
From pyramidal hall,—-
From Carnac's sculptur'd wall
From Thebes they loudly call-
   ""Retake your fame!""

""All hail Liberia! Hail!
Arise and now prevail
   O'er all thy foes;
In truth and righteousness
In all the arts of peace
Advance, and still increase,
   Though hosts oppose.""

At the loud call we rise
And press towards the prize,
   In glory's race;
All redolent of fame,
The land to which we came,
We'll breathe the inspiring flame,
   And onward press.

Here Liberty shall dwell,
Here Justice shall prevail;
   Religion here;
To this, fair Virtue's dome
Meek Innocence may come,
And find a peaceful home,
   And know no fear.

Oppression's cursed yoke,
By freemen shall be broke—
   In dust be laid;
The soul erect and free,
Here evermore shall be;
To none we'll bend the knee
   But Nature's God.

Proud Science here shall rear
Her monuments, to bear
   With deathless tongue;
By nations yet unborn
Her glories shall be known,
And Art her tribute join,
   The praise prolong.

Commerce shall lift her head,
Th' auspicious gales shall spread
   Expanded wing;
From India's spicy land,
From Europe's rock-bound strand,
From Peru's golden strand
   Her tribute bring.

Oh Lord! we look to Thee
To Thee for help we flee,
   Lord, hear our prayer!
In righteousness arise,
Scatter our enemies,
Their hellish plots surprise
   And drive them far!

O happy people they,
Who Israel's God obey,
   Whose Lord is God;
They shall be blest indeed,
From anxious cares be freed,
And for them is decreed
   A large reward.

By doing well that which you have to do.
Place high the standard of your heart's desire,
And let your deeds some other heart inspire.

And should you overtake, upon life's road,
Some weary pilgrim, bent beneath his load,

Fail not to pause, and help him on his way,
For time thus spent, is counted not delav.
And when you come to where the paths diverge,
Toward the right be sure to urge

All those who fain would go the other way,
To follow you, lest they should go astray.
And let your voice be that of one who cheers 
The lonely heart, and makes it smile through tears

Be tender, patient, generous and true,
Lend strength to weaker hands stretched out to you,
And when at last the sands of life have run,
The consciousness of deeds thus nobly done,
Will be the beacon light of Paradise,
To guide your spirit safely to the skies.",July,1903,Colored American Magazine,Walter W. Wallace,,male,,,Boston,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your neck, arch'd so sweetly above
The undulation of your breast
Like ocean swells in slow unrest,
With such exquisite motions act
Like captious, yearning cataract,
It seems from some sweet source to swell
Full, passionate and musical.
I would not praise too much your charms;
The curvature of your fair arms;
For the hand that modeled you
Gave every line respective due.
Laborious tho' his task begun.
'Twas pleasure when he viewed you, done.
Whatever might his joy have been
'Tis confident he tried again
To give you more than sculptured grace
In lineaments of form and face.
He tuned the strings of soul and sense
To notes of soothing elegance;
The quintessence of April's dream
In varying moods of shade and sheen
Tempered the phases of your mind.
To fancies changeful as the wind.
He gave you joy, the crown of life,
Pure metal unalloyed with strife;
And just enough of passion, too,
To make you madd'ning thro' and thro'.
But these mere words do ill supply
The color to paint my visioned eye.
The blended beauty in you, glows
Of lily, violet and rose;
The lily, symbol of thy pure
Chaste, gracious soul; the lure
Of spiritual radiance, which,
Shrine you a saint in holy niche;
But when endowed with saddened mien
Apensive violet you seem,
A tender, tearful, yearning child
Of fragrant senses, frail and mild.
And then, you too can turn to be
Agorgeous rose divinity--
Love, life and passion smiling thro'
The perfect fullness of your hue!

Columbia's Disgrace,Townsend Allen,Allen,"Ay, black was the man, and black was the deed,
But blacker by far was the lawless creed
Of those lawless men with their faces white
Who avenged the deed in the dead of night!

For black were the hearts of that howling mob,
And worthy of Hades their fiendish job!
A shudder of horror around the globe ran,
At this beastly revertal of civilized man!

The earth holds no record of more barbarous scene,
No wild, savage orgie in history's dark screen
Surpasses in demon-like hatred and spite,
The deed of those white men that shameful night.

And this, on Columbia's ""land of the free!""
Beneath the bright flag whose stars all decree
A perfect equality, justice; above all
Protection by law, until those stars fall!

And this, when we reprimand Russia, in sooth!
And prate of our liberty, freedom and truth!
The nations of earth point the finger of scorn
At Columbia's banner, blood stained and torn!

Shame! shame on the brutes who let loose on the land
This Spirit of Lawlessness! 'Twas Southern hand.
First took up the fagot, the torch and the stake,
And started these fires which 'twill take blood to slake.

Defiant of law, both of man and of heaven,
They lynched and they roasted alive! Now this leaven
Contagious is working; but God is not blind;
They'll reap the wild whirlwind, who sow the wind!

   Bears messages to you.

The New Battle Hymn,Townsend Allen,Allen,"Again is heard the crying of the children in the night,
They are praying to the Father to defend their legal right,
They are praying him for justice swift against illegal might,
Their race is marching on.

These children of the nation now are growing wise and strong,
They have suffered long in silence, under selfish Southern wrong,
But they know that rank injustice has been meted to them long,
Their race is marching on.

Their rights by constitution have been quibbled quite away,
The ballot taken from them so they ne'er can have fair play;
They're accused and without trial are strung up the selfsame day,
But their race is marching on.

It's ""lynch 'em, lynch 'em, lynch 'em, there's no law for black men here,""
""Tar and feather, shoot, and burn 'em, there is nobody to fear;""
""This is the white man's country and no niggers wanted near,""
But their race is marching on.

God's eye doth aye behold them, there's no ""color line "" on high,
His ear is open to them, He hears every sob and cry;
He sits in righteous judgment, every soul that sins shall die,
Their race is marching on.

The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small,
It cost a millions lives or more to make the shackles fall;
'Twill cost a million lives again, the wormwood and the gall,
Their race is marching on.

Inspiration,Hezekiah Butterworth,Butterworth,"I.

The highest aims forever live,
And reach sublime events,
They prophesy and they fulfil,
And bring divine contents.
Oh, town beside the purple bays,
A tale of Lincoln here
I bring to thee, in whose events
Thine own high aims appear;
For grow in life all grand intents.
In noble thoughts and deeds,
As Servius Tullius' hopes lived on
And bloomed at Runnymeade.

II.

He turned away from crystal halls,
And bowed himself in prayer,
Lincoln, the commoner, beloved;
A sergeant waited there.
The door swung back; and Lincoln said,
""The invader's arm is riven.""
""Whence comes the news?"" the sergeant asked.
""The message came from Heaven!""
Once over our flag stood still the sun,
Three nights were a day, and three days were one,
That day was Gettysburg!

This morn to Heaven I raised my voice,
""Give us thy power divine,
And I the bondsmen's chains will break.""
Heaven said, ""The field is thine.""
I stood in silence, came the word,
""The battle has begun.""
And on the eastern windows burned
The red midsummer sun.

III.

He walked alone the halls of state,
Our Lincoln, the beloved;
Afar the thunder clouds of fate
The serried hilltops moved.
But mustering hosts of blue brigades.
He saw not, clear nor dim;
When forth the mighty columns passed '
Twas history past to him.
Once over our flag stood still the sun,
Three nights were a day, and three days were one,
That day was Gettysburg!

IV.

Another day the heavens rend,
Earth's axle bends and sways,
On three times fifty thousand men,
Two hundred cannon blaze,
No soldier knew what night would bring
To that uncharted field,
To him who sought Heaven's council hall
It was alone revealed.

V.

When Pickett's men had cleft the fields,
Hills leaped in horror dire,
They stood like men with lifted shields,
While the gray lava's fire
Sunk into ashes, thin and pale,
Then swift the heroes formed
And all the wavering force assailed
That, baffled, force had stormed.
Once over our flag stood still the sun,
Three nights were a day, and three days were one,
That day was Gettysburg!

VI.

The meteor flag that flashed from Heaven,
Then lightened in the cloud,
And 'neath the skies thrice thunder -riven
The Alleghaneys bowed.
July the third; the cloud wings reft
Revealed again the sun;
The skies of Liberty shone clear,
And those three days were one.

VII.

Lincoln! To consecrate the field,
To Gettysburg he came,
As on that morn when earth stood still
In Heaven's arrested flame.
The blue brigades around him pressed,
As they had ever done,
And waited for the prophet's word,
Ten thousand men as one.
Once over our flag stood still the sun,
Three nights were a day, and three days were one,
That day was Gettysburg!

VIII.

Care-worn, he bent on them his face,
The centuries were there,
'Twas thinner than that hour when Heaven
Its message sent through prayer.
He spake: ""The dead have given this spot
The glory that is due,
That the Republic perish not,
Let us to them be true!

IX.

O Gettysburg! O Gettysburg!
O day of days sublime,
That made new destinies for men
And set the clock of time.
'Twas that worn face that summoned Heaven
His heroes to enfold,
And saw the hosts invisible
Like the young king of old.

X.

Helpers invisible there are
That prophet souls may know,
O'er them night's silver irises
Of apperception glow.
The earth revolves in spirit zones,
And circles spirit spheres,
And oft life's choral overtones
Are heard by saints and seers,
So over our flag stood still the sun,
Three nights were a day, and three days were one,
That day was Gettysburg.

XI.

On Seminary Ridge increase
The fruited fields of fall,
And far the Susquehanna gleams
Beneath her mountain wall.
Peace lifts her white hand in the heaven,
Above each turf- ribbed hill
Where on the day with thunder riven
The sun of fate stood still.

XII.

Such is my tale of Gettysburg,
But, Barrington, to thee,
An hundred years before, God spake
That thou thy bondmen free,
And here where Williams breathed the word
That conscience throned to rule,
Where Myles for liberal knowledge made
Each cabin home a school,

XIII.

The silver trump of freedom blew,
In life's diviner air,
And thence Emancipation grew
To power in Lincoln's prayer.
From here went freedom on her march
That human victories won,
Until o'er Gettysburg's grand arch
Our Prophet held the sun.

XIV.

O, town beside the purple bays,
That build in life's diviner air,
To-day we see thy ancient ways,
The high creative power of prayer.
Thy past has larger dowers to give,
To all mankind in word and deed,
So Servius Tullius still doth live
In memories of Runnymeade.

XV.

To Lincoln's faith at Gettysburg
Let us our pledge renew,
A Genius noble summons us,
Time's work supreme to do.
Come, Oh thou Diva, come and bring
The gifts the building ages sing,
To man his birthright, toil a field,
To need a largess true,
To each the justice of the state,
To all the wealth that they create,
To him who toils, his due.
So shall we live in gems enscrolled
Like those who broke the chains of old.

Just a Friend,Clifford E. Jones,Jones,"Say, can it be you do not know
That in the Summer long ago,
My friendship into love did grow?
Until, sweetheart, I loved you so,
That all else in this world beside meant
      Naught to me.

Sometimes I feared that you keen eyes
Would surely pierce my love's disguise.
And end my dream of Paradise
With just one look of pained surprise,
To know that love now shared the place
      Where friendship ought to be.

But now the lesson I must learn,—
To quench the fires of love that burn
Into my soul, and make it yearn
For that which you can ne'er return;
For well I know, that just a friend is all
       You sought to be.

The Violin,A. Gude Deekun,Deekun,"Weird and eerie violin
What spirit strange hast thou within,
That from thy seeming empty shell
Would man-forbidden secrets tell?
What means the medley of their tones,
The laughter, wailing, shrieking, groans;
Then tender, whispering, sighing strain
That sets us dreaming, causing pain
And longings fierce for things unknown,
For lives wrong spent to make atone;
And changing swift to light and gay,
With feet-compelling notes that sway
And claim us to their revelous mood,
Forgetting care with all its brood
Of earthly ills that hold and thrall,
Alike the portion of us all?
Anon from 'neath thy quivering strings
A thrilling, vibrant challenge rings,
A pure, sublime, inspiring theme,
Uplifting, nerving, till we seem
With any fate prepared to cope,
Through any fate prepared to hope.

Glen' Barney,Augustus M. Hodges,Hodges,"Twas on a bright midsummer morn,
The sun sent down its hottest ray,
And parched the blades of growing corn,
And turned the verdant grass to hay,
That old Aunt Susan, hat in hand,
Rushed into ""Squire Tatem's "" store;
(Twas in Virginia, understand,
In those bright days soon aft' the war,
When every vote was counted right,
When Truth and Justice had the sway,
And magistrates were black, not white
Before the ""New South "" had its way ).

""Oh! Br'er Tatem, giv' me quick
Er warrant fur Glen Barney's ' ress,
Glen beat my gal wid dis yere stick,
An' throwed her down an' tored her dress,
An' rushed at me wid er big knife,
An' chased me 'round de ole hog pen,
An' threatened fur ter take my life,
So, Br'er Tatem, please ' ress Glen!""

It happened on that very day,
The constable, young Frederick Bright,
Had called to pass the time away,
In talking politics till night;
But when he heard Aunt Susan tell
Of this wild outlaw's thirst for gore,
The brave young fellow's courage fell;
He quickly started for the door.

""Come back, young man!"" the Justice cried,
(""And you go home now, Sister Brown."")
The frightened officer replied:
""I can't, I've got to go to town.""
""Come back and serve this warrant, Bright;
You must not shirk from duty, Fred.
Find Barney if it takes all night,
And bring him here alive or dead.

""I'll show that fellow he can't do
Just as he please while I'm aroun '
When he's in jail he'll sadly rue
The day he threatened Sister Brown.""
Poor Freddy wished ten times or more
He'd stayed at home upon that morn,
Instead of coming to the store,-
He also wished Glen ne'er was born.

He sadly read the warrant through:
""July the 16th, 72, Virginia County, Princess Ann
""To Frederick Bright I here command ""
(Which reads as near as rhyme can tell),
""Whereas, One Glenmore Barney fell,
Upon one Susan Brown with knife,
And threatened he would take her life,
And badly beat the plaintiff's daughter,
Then threw her down in mud and water,
And otherwise did show his hate
For all the laws of this good State,
That I command you, Frederick Bright,
To bring before me, here to-night,
The body of the said Glenmore
Barney, to be tried by law,
With seal affixed, my name you see,
Moses Tatem, a J. P.

So Freddy filled his pistols three,
And took the handcuffs from the store,
Got on his horse with trembling knee,
And started out to find Glenmore.
(To the warrior it may be
Endless glory, as 'tis said,
After fighting for the free,
To get a bullet in his head.)
Still, every sound made Freddy start
As on he rode with bated breath.
Our hero knew lead in the heart
Meant only now a fameless death.

At last he reached the ""Taylor Farm""
Where wicked Barney's deeds were done.
He threw the handcuffs 'cross his arm,
And cocked and primed his ready gun.
As up he rode before him stood,
A pretty maid, with yellow face,

And Fred cried out: ""The wretch who would
Harm such beauty, doth disgrace
The name of man, and is a brute.
To drown him would pollute much water,
And powder's wasted if I shoot,-
For is not this Aunt Susan's daughter?""

""Where is that Glenmore Barney now?""
He yelled, (for beauty made him brave )
""Where is the cur, for here I vow
To send him to a timely grave!""
""My name is Glen - Glendelia, sir,""
Replied the maid of golden hue,
""How dare you class me as a cur?""
""What! You Glen Barney! Is it true?""

He looked into her eyes of black,
As there he sat on steed of white;
Out went his heart; she sent her's back,
'Twas as of yore -love at first sight.
'Twas ""Maud"" again, and country Judge,
Of schoolboy lore and world renown,
""Rich repiner and household drudge,""
Our ""Maud"" was yellow, our ""Judge ""was brown.

Law knows not love; love knows not law,
Still Fred remembered why he came.
So he resolved without a flaw,
To do his duty, just the same.
""Well, Glen - that is Miss Barney, I
Am very sorry it is true,
But tell the truth, the reason why
I came down here, is after you.

""This morning, old Aunt Susan Brown,
Rushed into 'Squire Tatem's store,
And had him write this warrant down,
Which puts you in the hands of law.""
Frederick read the warrant through,
The maiden listened with a smile.
""I beat her daughter, it is true,
Because she called me names most vile.""

""Then, as my prisoner you must go
With me up to the 'Squire's store,
Just tell him all the facts you know,
And have no fear about the law.""
With arms akimbo, Miss Glen said,
The fire flashing in her eye,
""Before I'll go, I'll be shot dead,
I will resist until I die.

""What, go to jail for old Aunt Sue,
And her old gal, Maria Brown?
I will not go for them or you,
Nor all the constables in town!""
""But Glen, you know the warrant said,
(I read it through without a flaw )
That I must take you, live or dead,
You know, dear girl, that is the law.

""I'll get a buggy for you, Glen,
And drive you with the utmost care,
Pray, for my sake, will you go then?
You'll come out right, so never fear.
Go for my sake, my pretty maid,
I vow you'll never go to jail,
Oh, trust me, do not be afraid,
For I will freely stand your bail.""

Glendelia smiled, and so did Bright,
And then she said she'd go, but walk.
This gave the constable delight,
And also gave him time to talk.
So ere they reached Judge Tatem's store,
The constable a story told,
The same old story as of yore,
The story that will ne'er grow old.

It only took five minutes ' time
Before the learned Justice read:
""Glendelia Barney did no crime,
When she resented what was said.
She only did the things she should,
When she was called that wicked name.
Why, Sister Brown, I know you would,
And so would I, have done the same.

""The case's dismissed, the prisoner's free,
This calling names is wicked sport,
The plaintiff losing, as you see,
Must settle all the costs of court.""
The constable walked off with Glen,
And here we might as well just say
Before we throw aside our pen,
He married her on Christmas Day.

If I Had a Million ,S.A. Beadle,Beadle,"If I had a million dollars I don't know what I'd do,
But I sometimes think I'd stroll around and squander a few;
Or, maybe I'd steel away to the country's quietude
And spend the rest of life among the simple and the rude.

I harldy think with the fashionable I'd be imbued,
And the society woman I swear I would elude;
Nor should the bosoms 'of my Sunday shirts be immaculate-
Even a million, I don't think, my cranium would inflate.

Because I'd like to slip a cog. and go it with a bit,
With my soul aglow of passion for my brother in the pit ;
Proud to be with the commoners, I'd rusticate awhile,
Nor would I care a cursed thing about the latest style.

“Brogan shoes and homespun socks?"" The very things I need,
For too much dress and fashion would my lithe step impede;
A single gallus, friend, would hold my breeches on to me,
And I'd not care a snap about their bagging at the knee.

The doctrine of the broad-brimmed hat I'm sure I would not heed.
I believe in reducing things to what we really need;
Besides I've always been content under a brimless cap,
To go it with the urchins a-frolicing, jolly chap.

With them I'd like to take just now a little bit of ease,
A lounging where I used to, out under the apple trees,
A whittling and swapping jokes with Bill and Tom and Ned,
And let our mem'ries Ait around the lore of the trundle-bed.

Aye, over and above it all, this is the simple truth:
If I'd it, and could, I would spend a million for my youth!
Then with my true love I would go a sparking it again,
And look the love upon her my tongue could never explain.

To lead her once again, my friend, through the old Virginia reel :
To salute her, to balance all; again, to fondly feel
The same old bliss I used to while swinging corners all
And stepping to the music of the jocund country ball,

Were worth millions of yellow pelf to a maimed old chap like me,
And I'd give it, if I could, with a zest of childish glee.
Oh! if I could but put away my gout and rhumatis',
And take an old-time outing from the pressure of my ""biz,""

With a bonny girl and youth I'd go to the fair old sunny clime,
Down the sylvan haunts of Dixie, where the jessamines ever twine;
Where the lillies faint of sweetness, and ever blows the thyme;
Where the seasons all are summer and the climate is sublime !

Where the rose aflame of beauty, drops its petals on the sward,
Geraniums blush to scarlet; the passion flowers nod
And the breezy sweep of zephyrs brings on the metric chime
Of the winged minstrelsy in in the glory of their prime..

If you could take the silver from this old pate of mine,
Call back my youth a-gambling down yon vista way sublime,
And bring me back my true love, my long-lost love again,
Up from among the daisies where she so long hath lain ,

The million dollars you might have and millions o'er and o'er
Again I'd take my love and youth and ask for nothing more.",January,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,Male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alfred_Beadle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But love is there to soothe my care,
And brother John has pride,
So I pity him while I revel there,
For his is a world of care. 

My brother John has a fertile farm
Broad fields of cotton and corn,
Naught have I but the deep blue sky,
Just space to look upon,
And a barren spot behind his lot,
He assigns to me as home;
But I feel for John as I revel there
For his is a world of care.

My brother John's lord of a town,
While I not a hovel own;
Without a home the world I roam,
A happier man than John.
I know not why that John and
I Have drifted so far apart,
And I feel for him, my brother there;
For his is a world of care.

My brother's hold is fixed on gold,
A carriage and horses four;
And they draw their load over the paved road
With a flash and a dash by the poor.
When go I must, I tramp through dust
Alone where they have sped,
Yet I feel for John as I revel there;
For his is a world of care.

My brother John has a splendid lawn,
Scythed and rolled and green,
A verdured spot of which I'm not
Even allowed to dream,
To all that pass, “Keep off the grass,""
Is the order, and I keep on,
Yet I envy not for I am happy here
On the commons of brother John.",May,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alfred_Beadle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Africa--A Medley,E.L. Blackshear,Blackshear,"Her limbs in chain
From cross the Main
By Slaver brought
To Freedom's shore,
By art untaught,
Of savage Lore,
And simple thought--
   Africa.

Of massive frame,
Of patient mood,
She reeks no blame, 
But wears her yoke--
For others' good.
To plow, to hoe,
To sing, to sow,
To plant, to toil
On others' soil--
   Africa.

In cotton rag,
With cotton bag,
To pick the boll,
And sing the while,
From dawn to dark.
In cabin bare,
A Spartan's fare,
She waits till dawn--
   Africa

Her fetich lore
Here now forgot,
She learns to pray
Her captor's way--
To laugh, to speak,
To jest, to weep,
In Freedom's land--
   Africa. 

To raise her brood,
To chew her cud,
In Stoic mood-
The under sill,
The stone as mill,
She waits on God-
(And Appomattox)
   Africa.

Black shoulders bare,
The burden there
A Nation's load-
She tills—and toils,
Nor reçks of spoil,
Enduring all-
This Atlas-
   Africa. 

Her heart grew warm
As her skin was black,
And of love for her captors
In that heart was no lack.
And she loved her own,
And still loved them
For the milk of her kindness
O'erflowed at the brim.
Then the land grew angry
And the lightnings flashed,
Of the cannon's mouthings
And the bayonet's dash.
Then the land was still
And the soil was red
As silent and mourning
They huried their dead.

But God heard her prayer and God heard her song
In the wide field of cotton and the corn rows long,
For He moved on His throne and His bright glory shone,
For in all His wide Dominions shall His will be done.

Then Africa looked to the God of her trust
And wept for she felt that her God was just-
Then Africa looked in the face of her brood,
And rejoiced for she felt that God was good.",March,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Africa, Labor, Slavery, Religion",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christopher Marlowe,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"O you who wrote your sounding line
On Shakespeare's mighty mind and heart,
Before the time of Goethe's art
Delivering the sisters nine,
What measures can such lips as mine
Unto your further fame impart,
Within whose soul a song did start,
Even when you sank in Omar's wine?
With Barabas I count my gold,
And delve in murders manifold;
With Tamburlaine I rule the world,
And then with Faust to hell am hurled;
I hear the steady onward tramp
Of armies on the battle-plain ;
And then I feel the dew and damp,
And rest forever with the slain.
With you I tramp the London street,
And see the good and evil there;
With you a demon's curse repeat,
Then up to glory I repair;
For if there is a heaven to win,
Above the ken of mortal eyes,
Why wander in the ways of sin,
Beyond the pale of Paradise ?
I often wonder when I read
These tales of vast and vague desire,
How happy are those mortals freed
From such excess of love and fire,
But when I think of this man's state,
And all his meeds of joy and pain

The Dawn ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"There came a dark youth singing in the dawn
Of a new freedom, to a mellow lyre,
Refining, as with touch of an Apollo's fire,
The songs a lowly people sang upon
A toilsome way. The night of gloom was gone;
He stood, full-throated, cheering son and sire
To garner grain, despising rain and mire
Of yesternight. ""To-day,"" he sang, ""toil on
And up, my race, from vale toward glory's crest!""
Men marvelled at the singer, strong and sweet.
He left the forest, drenched with storms of night,
And faced the morning, beautiful with light,
To die while shadows still fell toward the west,
And leave his laurels at a people's feet.",May,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,"Progress and Racial Uplift, Religion",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   Wherein I thought the fairy muses dreamed.
   Thither so oft I went that soon it seemed
My soul, when lonely, sought that quiet dale.
So I would go; and, when all else would fail,
   Peace met me there, with gentle eyes that streamed
   In sympathy; and Hope came; and I deemed
That, sheltered safe from every stormy gale,
   Dreaming sweet dreams, 'twere sweet to rest me there
   Forevermore. And, haply, soine sweet bard
Might see my grave, and sing, while cooed the dove,
   And breathed the balm of 'fumed air and sward,
Of life and death, and mystery, and love;
   And all the tender hopes that waft us up above.",April,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Sonnet,male,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/james-d-corrothers-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Peace of God ,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I.
I sat at eve, as the sun sunk low,
And the shadows grew, and the dark came down,
Where the sea moved restlessly to and fro,
At the foot of a dreamy, old, picturesque town,
And I listened and dreamt to the sea's mournful sound,
And my heart beat heavy and sad and slow
As the waves that moaned on the sands below,
While the ships went by, and the night fell 'round.

II.
And I thought of the friendships that faded away,
And the lost hopes that left me so sad and alone;
Ambitions that towered and fell to decay;
And many a loved one, long silent and gone,-
Dear virtues, as pure as the clouds that looked down,
So, white, o'er that dreamy, old, picturesque town;-
And my heart beat heavy and sad and slow,
As I turned the dim leaves of the dear long ago,
And watched the ships pass, as the night fell 'round.

III.
And I thought, as the ghoulish dark crept o'er the land,
Of a sweet, dreamy face, like the meadows in May;
And the soft, thrilling touch of a pretty, brown hand;
And a love that died as the beautiful day
Had perished that night, in that heedless old town, -
With its spires all white, and its hills all brown;-
But my dream died, too, in its bed of woe,
And the waves made its dirge on the sands below,
While the weird shadows strove with the darkness all 'round.

IV.
The stars came silently out up above,
To watch o'er the grave of the beautiful day;
And the moon, a proud creature, too cold for our love,
Came, veiling her face, in a mystical way;
And, roaming the still sky, looked wondering down
On me—and that dreamy, old slumbering town,
And my heart's blood froze, as I sat there alone,
And heard the waves chanting their requiem-like tone,
While the dim ships, like phantoms, went past on the sound.

V.
I sat there, and looked at night's banner unfurled,
With all its rich beauties and wonders so rare;
And I thought that each star was a happier world,
And confess that I longed, like a child, to be there,
Where the holy ones pity us, as they look down
On our Earth, with her many a sin-blinded town,
And hearts that beat heavy and sad and slow,
'Till they break and fail, and unheeded go,
While the world moves on in the same old round.

VI. 
Then I railed against Christ, as I sat there alone,
For blinding the world with His weak fairy tale;
And I wondered why God, on His thunder-girt throne,
Allowed useful lives and their strivings to fail;-
And I told the great God to His teeth that He lied!
That they who best served Him mankind crucified-
And weary and heart-sore and crazed with despair
I paced the bleak seashore, and muttered a prayer
To the winds!—but it died in the chill evening air.

VII.
Away in the midnight, I made me a prayer,
And sent it to God, on His beautiful throne, -
The calm moonlight slept in the deep, silver air;
But the moon glittered coldly and proudly alone,
And the stars, twinkling high in the blue sky, looked down
Like pitying eyes o'er that desolate town,--
When my prayer came back, on its pinions of snow,
That beat the still air into music below,
And my soul was amazed at the peace it had found.

VIII.
Then I spake to the Lord, as I journeyed along,
""Dear God, Thou hast sent me a blessing in tears;
I only can give Thee the poor, broken song
Of a soul that hath found Thee thro' doubts and thro' fears;
But, break my heart, Lord, and, if balm Thou should'st find,
Give it, in mercy, to erring mankind.""
And I heard the low words, as they issued in air,
Borne off on the wings of my hovering prayer,
And the night grew glad with its lingering there. ",June,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,Religion,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/james-d-corrothers-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Voice of the Negro ,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"Stop! O, Nation, stop and listen!
Listen with your heart and brain,
Hear the weird Voice of the Negro,
Coming up from Southern plain :
From the brakes of Louisiana,
From the fields of whit’ning grain,
From the lees of Mississippi,
Listen, as it comes again.

Not for social recognition,
Not for alms this Voice is rife.
For this, and only this 'tis pleading--
A man's chance in the race of life.
For an equal chance to labor,
And honest pay for honest toil;
Give this, and by the God who made us,
We'll win success on Southern soil. 

We still have hope, tho' darkness lowers,
And tbunders spread their dread alarms;
Faith in the best blood of the Southland,
Faith in the strength of our own arms,
Faith in the truth, tbo’crushed and bleeding;
That justice in man's heart still dwells,
We'll kiss the rod, then rise and labor,
God reigns above, and all is well.",February,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Labor, Progress and Racial Uplift",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/daniel-webster-davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Door ,Henry Davis Middleton,Middleton,"Despair and darkness veils the rugged way
   That winds o'er crag and barren plain and moor,
Where plods the fearless freedman day by day,
   Up to the open door.

Through the wide portals beacons break the gloom
   Now shadows flee, the night is almost o'er
And in the gloaming dusky freedom loom
   With faith, simple and pure.

O, cruel fate that beckons and betrays,
   'That shatters hope and fair forebodings dim,
All, all seems lost, labor of nights and days,
   The door is barred to him.

Exile or alien from far distant shores,
   Find a warm welcome wait their wiles or wares,
While noble natives languish at the doors,
   Denied their honest shares.

Relent, arrogant censors, heed his call,
   Nor mock his pains nor mimic his sad plight,
Your fate is tempted by his rise or fall
   Rather than by your might.

Let then the portals open full and free,
   The lustrous light its obscure threshold bare,
Merit alone should be the master key,
   Let all the worthy share. ",May,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,male,"Racism, Slavery",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Refining Fire ,L.A.J. Moorer,Moorer,"What a cost to be pure! did it e'er strike your mind
That the gold so much prized in the fire was refined?
And the pearls of the deep by the divers are found,
At the peril of life their successess are crowned ?

Yea, the trees of the orchard the pruner must know,
If they bring forth the best of the fruit that can grow;
And the knife is applied to the vine ev'rywhere,
For production, of grapes that are luscious and rare.

Thus in life we are taught by the pain and the loss,
That the road to the crown is by way of the cross;
Christians pass through the furnace, the Savior to gain,
For with Him if they suffer, with Him shall they reign.

We may weep for a night but the morn bringeth joy,
Then the songs of rejoicing our tongues will employ;
Ev'ry storm that ariseth at some time must end,
Then the rainbow of promise and peace will attend.

Ev'ry soul must afflictions and trouble endure,
As the gold must be tried, so the soul to be pure,
As the pearl is secured at the peril of life,
So the soul in its triumph must pass through the strife.

Like the Savior who suffered and went to His rest,
Must His servants on earth find the home of the blest,
There to tell Him the story of how in the past
They suffered the crosses and are crowned at the last.",February,1904,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",Common Measure,Male,Religion,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present from the past;

Wrapped up in secret shame.

The curtain drawn again aside
Reveals another scene
Ambition rules whate'er betide;
Which shows what might have been.

Cupid's Defiance,John Henry Adams,Adams,"Southward the fleeting sun long since has sped,

Gleams with resplendence on the spotless now
That hill and house-top, mantle -like, o'erspread.
The snow-crown'd serrate peaks, once drear and dead,
Luminous ustre lend the glades below,
Where the green holly and the mistletoe
Supplant the summer's dormant flower -bed.

That mock the monotone of wintry hours,
Laughter and lay of lovers loudly ring,

The War is Ended,Clarence Emery Allen,Allen,"The strife is o'er; the bloody war is done;
The bitter night hath faded with a peaceful sun.
The roaring cannon at last is still
No more it thunders from the vale and hill.
The war is done; ah yes, 'tis o'er, 'tis o'er--
The streams of blood shall flow no more.

Ceased hath the parting of husband and wife—-
Of son with a mother in the evening of life.
Ceased have the tears and the sad good-byes
The groans of the wounded, the dying's cries.
Ceased hath the bugle's summoning blast;
Ah, the black night of slaughter and carnage is past.

March homeward the armies with ranks thinned and worn;
With vacancies telling that many shall mourn.
Some husband, some father, some son is not there
Among the pale numbers the battle did spare.
'Tis many, O many marched off to the fray,
That are not marching home with the numbers today.

O the children who'll look for a father in vain!
O the sweethearts who'll look for a lover that's slain!
O the wives who were happy ere came the great fight,
That are heart-broken widows and mourning tonight.
O think of the fathers the war's taken away!
Just think of the orphans who're hungry to-day!

The strife is o'er; the bloody war is done;
And the black night gives way to a peaceful sun--
But there's sorrow and tears that will not cease
With the glorious sun of the beautiful Peace.

The Problem,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"Ye who have the vision, ye who know the plan
Of the stretch of empire o'er the haunts of man—

Ye who claim dominion far as man can reach,
What are these wild doctrines that at home ye teach?

What is this new notion of the lust of laws,
Sheltered by your ensign, bargained for your cause?

Farther yet and farther spreads the eagle's wing,
Louder yet your triumph bids the heathen sing;

Farther yet and farther do your footsteps go,
Each new day a harvest of the seed ye sow.

Ye who now are seeking daily for your need,
What is this ye harbor? What is this ye breed?

This new hope of glory, this one great desire,
Daily growing fatter 'neath your altar fire?

What are these new statutes legislators make?
Strive they old foundations of your code to shake?

What is this proscription, what these brazen bars—
What this fearful fact, sirs, of the jim-crow cars?

Whence these gods of fury, at whose feet ye bow,
Relics of past ages ruling o'er us now?

One of your strong poets, virile and of sight,
Saw the fearful image, piteous in its plight,

Of a man of might, with muffled undertone,
Rolling, rolling, rolling up the hill a stone.

All the agitation, all the strife and woe,
All the stress and tumult forty years ago,

Left this mighty problem, covering all our land
Will ye crush the Negro or for justice stand?

Was it idle speaking, was it platitude,
Do we bend the meaning, dim the magnitude

Of the Declaration, which with good intent
Said some things most truly were self-evident?

Wherefore all its teachings do ye fail to heed?
Wherefore let ye folly wreck that noble creed?

Life is still unchanging; what ye craved for then
Craveth still the heart-throbs of a million men;

All ye fain would teach us by a sterner hand,
Do our minds beclouded fail to understand?

Ye who have the vision, ye who know the way,
Hear the mighty millions, singing as they pray

Heed the word the dubious present prophesies
List the music-making as the toilers rise,

Toiling with their faces turned upon the sun,
Rising yet more Godward when the day is done.

Ye who have the vision of the mighty hand,
Will ye crush the Negro or for justice stand?

Ye who have the gospel, ye who know the law,
Worship ye the night or what your fathers saw?

The Education,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"There was a time when Socrates
The wisdom of the young men drew,
When not such leaden forms as these
I see, were what the people knew;
But now the light the fathers burned
By other lights is overturned.

And now the Doric numbers flow
More slowly than in elder days;
And some less ancient Cicero
Now thunders forth in blame or praise;
To other gods than Zeus we throng,
For Homer in a worn-out song.

And now a people with a zeal
For things that they can make and see,
Forgets the lyric trance to feel,
Hears but the anvil's clank and plea;
And now the heart's most sacred tone
Is sacrifice to wood and stone.

The leaders of the nations strive,
But strive with water, air and fire;
And day by day they onward drive
Their sons, made mad by mad desire;
Yet as their phantoms they pursue,
I wonder if the gains are true.

Let me upon Olympus steep
Hold forth my unimpeded way;
There may I not forget to keep
The mystery of yesterday;
The life we live is more than meat;
Beware the creeds your lips repeat!

   Embosomed secrets hide ,
That ne'er shall reach humanity –
   Save with thy moving tide.
The magic of their beauty shall
   Make poets of the dumb
When faltered songs, like mine, must fail
   In years that are to come.

How sweet thy mellow song shall be,
   When thou hast lulled asleep
The discords of humanity
   That make thee sob and weep .
The music of thy moving then
   Will thrill the hearts of some;
For Peace shall walk the earth again,
   In years that are to come.

O vestal waters robed in haze!
   O mirrored, tranquil tide!
On thy enchanted course I gaze,
   As on thy ripples glide;
Tho ' in the dark depth pictures gleam ,
   I hear a voice speak low:
""You dream, but, ah ! were Life a dream,
   Time's waters would not flow.""

Flow, O thou stream incessant flow .
   Nor reck ' if in thy wave
The leaves of sorrow fall like snow ,
   And storms around may rave .
The storms that fret thy bosom wide
   Must in the distance cease ;
And leaves in thy resistless tide
   Shall be submerged in peace.

O years that still shall roll along,
   When I am silent clay,
If, 'chance, ye find this faltering song,
   Do with it as ye may;.
But, sweetly as the morning bright
   Dispels the shrouding gloom,
Turn thy dark features to the light,

Lincoln,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I.

Upon a flatboat, floating with the tide
Ofa great river, a young boatman stands,
Lofty of brow; great-hearted; in his hands
An oar to steer his craft. On either side
Of the broad river, sees he, stretching wide,
The waving corn fields and the cotton lands
Where slaves toil in the sun. One whose commands
They do, rides, whip in hand, with brutal pride,
And smites, with bloody, lacerating rod,
Their naked backs 'till crimson shows. ""Oh, God!""
Cries the tall woodsman,"" if thou hast a plan
To free these bondmen, hath the earth a son
To execute it, Father---even one?""
God's angel whispered: ""Aye! thou art the man.""

II

In after years a mighty statesman stood
Where two roads parted, pondering the way.
Over one road the seeming light of day
Streamed; dark the next road looked, and little good.---
The roads were Self and Human Brotherhood.
Self wound thro' scenes of glory, bright and gay,
While Brotherhood's high lights seemed ashen gray.
He might have chosen as a mortal would,
But for a vision sent him from above:
Again he heard the bondmen's wailing cry
In white fields stretching by a river dim;
Again God's angel came to plead with him.
Knowing it meant, perchance, that he must die,
He turned from Self to Brotherhood and Love.

A Face,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"A face of dreams and roses
Pleads tenderly with me- 
A sweet face that reposes
In death, so silently
Thro' the deep gloom, she seeks my room,
From o'er the Sunset Sea.
                        Alas!
The silent and mystic sea!


A face of dreams and roses,
Dainty as the woodlawns be,
Where every stream that flows is
A fairy rhapsody
Tinkling o'er rocks where sylvan flocks
Feed softly, tenderly.
                        My love,
So softly, tenderly.

A face of dreams and roses
Calm as an evening star,
Which, when the long day closes,
Shines holy, faint, and far
O'er lonely leas, and moonlit seas,
And coves where the fairies are,
                        My dear,
Where the beautiful fairies are

A memory, scattering roses,
She comes, from Dreamland blown- 
I dream, and my soul reposes
Entranced on her fairy throne;
And-roses - roses - roses
Drift on the moonlight, down.
                        O, Love!
On silvery moonlight, down.

O roses, gentle roses,
Ye die so soon, so soon!
Some live 'til summer closes,
But mine were plucked in June;
And life grew drear as the sea -hills sere
That gloom to the rising moon.
                        Ah, me!
To the dripping, and wan-faced moon!

And I think when memory closes
Her weary eyes, a-tire,
To dream o'er her pale, dead roses,
Mid murmurings sad and dire,
How my Love lay dead; and my soul, from red,
Glows white in pain's altar -fire.
                        My soul
Glows white in pain's altar -fire!

Green Apples,Daniel Webster Davis,Davis,"I have suffered from the measles, the whooping -cough and mumps;
I've had the scarlet fever, I've had the ""doleful dumps "";
I've had a mule to kick me 'till a thousand stars I've seen,
But the greatest pain I've suffered was from apples that were green.

I've had a goat to take my only shirt from off the line,
I've seen a fellow walk away with the girl I thought was mine;
I've even burst my pantaloons where all the world could see,
But the eating of green apples gave severer pains to me.

First I'd hear a mighty rumbling as of thunder far away,
And then a fearful gripping like wild demons at their play,
And then I'd bend double and just know I had to die,
And would see myself just flying through the mansions in the sky.

Mother'd give me paregoric, or a dose of ""Number Six,""
Just a little more pain killer and I sho ' was in a fix;
And then I'd swear I had enough, no more of them for me,
But next season always found me at that same green apple tree.

But now I've grown to manhood, and apples that are green
No more have power to tempt me, now their misery I have seen;
But there are other apples I still must learn to shun,
Tho' beautiful and tempting, there is death in every one.

A Prayer,E. Augusta Deace,Deace,"I do not ask, O Lord, in this short life,
In some sequestered, quiet nook to dwell;
Fain would I seek the battle's fiercest strife;
If Thou art near, I know that all is well.

I do not ask, O Lord, that Thou wouldst keep
My soul in heavenly pastures green and fair;
I pray for strength to comfort those who weep
Beneath a weary load of grief and care.

For perfect ease, O Lord, I do not ask;
Dost Thou not know Thy weak child's need of rest?

And peace at even on Thy loving breast!",September,1905,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,female,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Cotton-Field Melody,Leroy Ferguson,Ferguson,"Like winter's drifted snowflakes hoar
That tossed in old sleigh bells,
The dainty flakes of cotton white
Are rocking in tawny shells.

There's music in the snowy lint
Strains that the bondmen sang;
The doleful notes of the black man's grief
That once through the cotton-fields rang.

The melodies echo at the morn
A medley of bliss and woe
When Southern breezes are astir
And through the white fields blow.

Stretching from shore to shore,
Though thou didst give our kinsmen
Thou art the King, as of yore!",April,1905,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Slavery, Labor",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Playing it Out to the End,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"When you pull the trigger you've made your last play;
Hold on and your luck might change
In a moment your night may be turned to day,
In a manner as sudden as strange.

'Tis cowardly boys to throw down your hand
When you may not be pleased with the deal;
Play it out to the end and perhaps your stand
May some brilliant surprises reveal.

Full many a lad in the game of life
Has found it even so;
When tired and worn with the heat and strife,
And ready to cash in and go;

That he needed only to hold his breath,
And wait but a little while,
To see the clouds which boded death
Break forth in a glorious smile;

While others with chances as good as his
Lost Faith and Hope and Heart,
And by way of the gun went down with a whiz
Went down with a maddening start.

'Tis cowardly, boys, to quit the game,
Let Fortune be foul or fair;
Play it out to the end, and perhaps your name
May shine in the mansions up there!

The Rescue,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"Fierce through the windows the red flame broke,
And dark and high rose the cloud of smoke.

Fearless the firemen fought the flame,
As leaping and dancing full onward it came.

By and by from the building a cry rent the air,
And the crowd saw a maid through the lurid glare.

""To the rescue!"" cried the captain brave,
""Who'll volunteer the woman to save?""

Quick as a flash six men made a rush
Straight for the building-and then came a hush.

E'en strong men whispered with bated breath,
As they said to each other, ""They're gone to their death!""

But in a few moments they hallooed and cheered,
For a man with a maid on his shoulders appeared.

They married -- the fireman bold and the dame
That bravely he snatched from the maw of the flame;

And oft while she's asleep in their little bed,
The wife that he saved from the flame so red,

The man wakes and rolls, and he says with each turn,
""Oh, Lord! how I wish I had let her burn!""

On every hand,

The cotton is ready for picking;
For all are glad,
And none is sad,

The cotton is ready for picking;
And sleep at night
With new delight,

Moves imperceptibly its way along,
Beneath whose surface, full, and free, and strong,
Sweeps the swift current, still to seaward bent,
Bearing with it each vain impediment
With which the dastard strives its course to stay,
And make it stagnant with young Hope's decay;
So now upon the selfsame continent
Whose sons a glory-crown'd defiance hurl'd
At Britain for her tried enslaver's arts,

A Shell,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Nay, once I have not seen the sea, nor know,
By long familiar ear, her varying mood,
And passionate swell , but here upon this rood,
I found this gypsy bard of hers and, lo!
Close -fitted to my ear, in gratitude,
It murmurs of its far-off parent flow.
O, wander Sprite! what Viking fortitude
Left thee, stranded waif, achance wind's blow?
I am a Shell, far from my native shore;
Unlike thee, gypsy bard, my long exile
Has made my native speech remembered vain;

Herbstgefuhl,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"The silence of night is abroad and far,
The Earth, empty of summer's song-filled hours,
Is quiet grown, tho' in her desert bowers,
Now deeply still, the querulous crickets mar
The silvery stilliness of moon and star;
Anear me, grieve the fading form of flowers,
The leafless trees despoiled of summer's dowers,
And black the fields with winter's blighting scar
The world seems dead as unfulfilled desires;
No touch is felt of that warm Spirit Birth,
Which from the seed awaking reaspires,
And makes Life victor in the realms of Death;
But still I know beneath the death-won blade
Spring's eviternal hopes are deeply laid.

The Dreamer,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Like vast nebulæ spinning into space
Scintillant worlds of light, his fine spun dreams
Are nebulæ of thought; no failure seems
To daunt him nor despair; but calm the face
He shows the world; if once he wept, no trace
Of tears appears; but still about him gleams
With loftiness of soul, a light that streams
Across our meaner paths and sordid place;
Like one who walks in mist or dusk is blurred,
He fares among mankind with lofty brow,
And half of what he dreams is true and wise,
Tho' indistinct and dim, like music heard
In sleep; but seldom does our faith allow
The wisdom of his clearer, subtler eyes.

The Higher Morn,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Ah, Gentle One! with patient eyes,
I've waited long to catch one gleam
Of that fair morn of hazeless skies,
When we might stray afield and dream.

To wander free beyond the line,
Where town and country, failing, meet,
Till far behind us fail and pine,
The long lights of the narrow street.

So oft when morn from dewy bed
Arose with rosy cheeks aglow,
Within my heart of Love I said:
""There lifts the day my eyes would know.""

Awhile on crag and peak, a light
Would burn, and flood the gentle slope,
And ere my heart could catch delight,
That dawn, at birth, had died like Hope.

One morn, when at my vigils I,
You came with subtle eyes to plead,
When hopes have failed and dark the sky
To grant Love's words a better meed.

Your words are soft and soothing, Sweet;
In my dark heart beget was born,
At Love's birth-hour, with twilight fleet,
That longed-for, higher-lifting Morn.

The Past ,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Safe by my study fire
Wrapped in the peace of dreams
Time, like an ashen pyre,
Burns down to fits and gleams.

Wrought in the ashen heap,
Magic or fairy-made,
Strange-meaning figures peep
With large eyes unafraid .

""What was the last page read,
There where I made a pause?
Greece with her arts has lead
Rome with her civic laws.

""Let me reflect on this---
What is the Truth to heed
Law is a social bliss,
Art is a higher need.

Strange how that fire doth hiss!
What be these Imps I ken
Tragic, grotesque, amiss
Far from the forms of men?

""Look how their faces writhe!
Hideous, black and severe,
Impish old men and blithe,
Comic of manners, leer.

""Avaunt! this is not Art
Fashioning impish old forms'
Greece is gift of the heart,
Rome of glory of arms.

Greece of story and song,
Home of blind Homer's lyre,
Rome of conquering wrong:
Caesar's Eagles afire.

Lechery, forum, mart
Spell out the Roman life;
All of her song and art
Throve in the seethe of strife.

Greek of Apollo's Greece
Strove with the gods of song,
Basked in the smiles of Peace
Far from the clash of Wrong.

How many golden names 
Leap to the tongue for birth!
Half that the World's-need claims
Drew from her Mother-earth.

Peace! Art! kindred in time
Laurelled the Grecian brow--- 
Ye who seethe in the slime:
Such is the judgment now!

Galley and slave for Rome,
Beat by the might of power,
Borne to the Captor's home,
Foil to his triumph's hour.

But, see! there in the ash,
Transfigured by red brands,
No longer Imps abash
But men, with human hands,

With human Souls, arise;
Men, fellow-souls of mine,
With kindly human eyes
Beseech a friendly line.

""The Ages-past my will 
I thought oblivious years,
Here rise to haunt me still
With goblin shapes and fears.

""Alas! I've lived in vain,
Beyond the present hour
With hunger for a pain
Of high creative dower.

""Greece! Rome! what have I learned 
From thine imperious pride? 
When such as these have yearned,
Unsolaced lived and died.

""The Past, a Banquet Ghost,
Comes back to haunt me dread;
When we have wished it most,
Then least the years are dead.""

The Greatest of These is Love,D.J. Jordan,Jordan,"No pleasing speech nor prophet's gift,
Nor worldly learning, though profound,
Nor yet e'en faith, that mountains lift
From their deep seats where doth abound
A thousand thousand treasures rare,
To heights where worlds in tuneful strain
Adore their Maker's might and care,
While angels join the glad refrain
Can make me but the vilest dust
In His clear sight in whom I trust.

Though to the poor I give my all
Of land and gold in richest store,
Aud - though, if such a fate befall,
I yield my body, as before
Did Latimer unto the flame,
I yet must be the merest dross,
With every weight of ancient blame:
E'en vain for me must be the cross.
Unless from hallowed heights above
My soul is charged with sacred love.

For prophecies shall one day fail,
And silv'ry speech be silent all;
And Time shall Wisdom's fort assail
And bid her boastful ramparts fall;
And we who, childlike, on the shore
Find pleasing pebbles here and there,
While seas of truth stretch out before
Us unexplored and richly rare;—
All these and we shall pass away,
But Love shall have an endless day.

Constancy,T. H. Malone,Malone,"Two stood at the bend of the road one day;
One day in the blossoming Spring,
One blushing while giving her heart away,
One sealing his love with a ring.
In the Spring with its loves and its whisperings,
In the Spring with its doves of the burnished wings,
Sing ho! for the loves of the Spring.
One stood at the bend of the road one day
And bowed in the wintry blast,
Long enough to unburden her heart and pray
As she thought of the loving past.
Thank God for the love of life's opening days
That lifts us above all life's gloomy ways,
And thank God for the love at the last.

Winter's Shroud,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The clouds descend and darken,
Wild blows the gale and cold;
The trees to the storm blasts hearken
Standing as sentries bold.
Their proud heads gently shifting
Paint pictures upon the sky,
And snow through the branches sifting
God's earth to beautify.

From caves in distant mountains,
The wild winds rushing come;
They still the voice of the fountains,
And hush the brooklet's hum.
The frost on windows sketching,
Thousands of forms unknown,
And far o'er the woodlands stretching
Jewels like chaff are strown.

A light thro the storm peeps under- 
'Tis Old Sol's charioteer
Rifting the clouds asunder,
Which dreamlike disappear.
And Winter, hoar rejoices
Girding his armor fast,
While the winds with a thousand voices
Answer his stormy blast.

Bidding the frost adieu.

Ripples a merry song---
Amillion sunbeams dance and play'

Like swallows on the wing,
And soft winds with sweet melodies
Caress the infant Spring.

Who rewards for duty done,

A Song to the Flowers,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The eye beholds the flowers in storied beauty,
That Nature's floor bedeck in royal state;
In every one a lesson taught of duty,
Or glory to the world they dedicate.

Beside the laughing brook in meadow straying,
They breathe their perfume on the passing air:
Their voiceless lips in silence are but saying
To Him that gave them birth a constant prayer.

Not within halls alone, where arch and column
Attest the feebleness of mortal hand,
But in that fane, most catholic and solemn,
A temple free, that God himself has planned.

They bloom in God's cathedral, vast and holy,
Kissed by the sun by day, the moon by night;
Where winds are ever singing softly, slowly.
They greet the worshiper with faces bright.

Were I perchance in distant lands remaining,
Far from the voice of every priest divine,
In company with flowers of His ordaining,
I should find peace with them, both priest and shrine.

Phantoms,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The shades of evening round my door are falling,
The last bright beams of sunlight fade away;
The nightingale his sad, sweet song is singing,
And darkness holds the place once held by day.

Thus while I sit Dame Fancy steals upon me,
And points my mem'ry heavenward toward the sky;
Methinks my soul is drifting onward, onward,
Far, far beyond this world to realms on high.

Then Spirits come and fill my soul with gladness,
I sit in company with sires of old;
They tell me of a brighter future for me,
And bid me press in patience to the goal.

I drift, methinks, adown the stream of Fancy,
And view the pleasures of another sphere.
When shall I find that bliss beyond all measure,
And leave behind this old, sad dwelling here?

With joy untold I see a throng, upspringing,
In spotless white around a dazzling throne;
They sing high praises to a Gracious Father,
Who welcomes home his ransomed ones, his own.

No sorrow, pain nor death that home can enter,
Where all is joy and peace forevermore;
Ever they toil in sorrow while earth-ridden,
But win the victory on the other shore.

I view the dark, dark river by mortals dreaded,
From which they shrink away they draw near.
Ah, would they could know that joy alone awaits them
When the Grim Boatman rows them from this sphere.

August,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"Tis sultry noon;
The warm and lazy winds blow o'er the plain,
Bearing the perfume of the flowers that soon
Are sought in vain.

The scene is still;
Save the faint whisper of the leaves all day
Rocked gently by the wind on dale and hill
They dance and play.

When morn is here
The myriad voices of the wood are heard;
And belts of every hue, so bright and clear,
The heavens gird.

The partridge sends
Throughout the quiet fields his flute like score,
Beside the hedge and where the golden billow blends
The wheat fields o'er.

Beside the pond
The lilies lift their heads to meet the sun,
And wait to greet the sister stars beyond,
When day is done.

The landscape glows with rich and beauteous light,
And Nature spreads her ""cloth of gold"" to hide

Meditation,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"I look today
From out the windows of this earthly home,
And catch a vista of the destined way
Of life that is to be. Awhile I roam
Amid the scenes of sorrow and delight,
Till death shall come and o'er this frame hold sway
And give me vaster sight.

                        Ah, who should fear
To pass the portals to the higher plane;
For life was not begun upon this sphere;
'Tis but a school that fits the soul to gain
A home immortal and completes the chain
That links us to the ones we love so dear.
I know not where our lost ones roam today
Within His vaulted realms of high ascent;
I only know that somewhere, far away,
Is ever peace and rest --- I am content.
And Hope is hov'ring with the promise sweet
That sometime, somewhere, we again shall meet.

Is ebbing, is drifting, and soon will be gone;
The ripening fruit all its fragrance is draining,
To mellow the air as the days hurry on.
   Sing, zephyrs, sing
      Your doleful music bring,
While the autumn leaves are reddening.

Blow gently, breezes, the flowers are going,
No more brightly glowing their faces are seen
Save the gold of the aster and the golden-rod blowing
And lifting their heads in the dull fadden green.
   Sing, zephyrs, sing
      Your doleful music bring,
For the autumn leaves are reddening.

Blow gently, breezes, the birds are all flying,
Are all swiftly flying where blue is the sky;
Forsaking their nests, for the leaves all are dying
That nightly have sung them their soft lullaby.
   Sing, zephyrs, sing,

Within the dells the autumn leaves lie dead,
And rustle in the breeze -a countless throng.

Within the path that it so lately sped,
In laughter o'er the pebbles in its bed.
Deep in my heart there steals a thought of wrong
Since all this beauty soon must fade away,
Forgetting that the Maker's will is right;-
Across the landscape all the autumn day
Fly cloudy shadows swift as eagles' flight;
Soon fades the beauteous sight of Summer's sheen,
Soon Winter calls unwelcomed and unseen.",November,1905,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,female,,,Atlanta,Predom. Black,https://bluetigercommons.lincolnu.edu/lll/15/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A December Day,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"Slowly the dawn is passing, slowly the daylight breaks,
Over the frozen landscape, drowsily life awakes;
   Chirping his note in merry glee
   The snow bird flits from tree to tree.

Over the dome of heaven stretches a cloak of gray
Veiling from longing vision, the lordly king of day;
   Rising he paints a glowing red
   Around the lofty mountain's head.

Fiercely the winds are calling, swiftly they race in glee
Bursting the chains that bound them, gladly they wander free;
   The barren trees that toss and groan
   Remurmur to the winds' low moan.

Falling with downy softness, down comes the fleecy snow
Silently as our blessings scattering to and fro,
   Peeping without with faces bright
   We see the earth in shroud of white.

Soon will the day be dying, and merry sleigh bells ring,
Making the young hearts happy, gladness and mirth they bring.
   Fain would I glide along with thee
   O youthful sleighers blithe and free.

The Hucksters,Ann Melody,Melody,"Tis summer and the blue bird's song
Is ringing over hill and plain;
The meadow brooks flow swift along,
Rejoicing in the summer rain;
The clouds above, like white -sailed boats,
Over a sea of azure floats,
While ever from the hucksters ' throats
Comes, ""Cabbage! Hard -head cabbage!""

'Tis evening and the gentle breeze
Is whispering softly through the trees;
The birdies make the woods resound,
While little nestlings huddle 'round;
While falls to sleep the cool, dark night,
Still in the fading, glimmering light,
The huckster cries with all his might,
""Corn, corn! Sure's you'r born, I got corn!""

'Tis August and the sweltering heat
Beats down on housetop, street and plain;
The breezes are but memories sweet,
In vain we scan the skies for rain.
The birds are still, the grass is dry,
All nature for a rain doth sigh,
While smiting e'en the hollow sky
Comes ""Cant'lope, cant'lope, cant'lope!""

September comes with skies of blue,
And trees are borrowing every hue
Of rainbow arch and sunset light
To deck themselves in colors bright.
Again the dallying zephyrs play
With trembling leaves in colors gay,
And still the huckster day by day
Cries, ""Millions! Watahmillions!""

It matters not if skies be fair,
Or smothering be the humid air,
Or the lightning's flashes mark the path
Of the god's of thunder in their wrath
All manner of weathers the huckster bears
And, rain or shine, to town he fares,.
And ever telleth of his wares,
""Taters! Sweet pertaters!""

The Afro-American Plea,Kelly Miller,Miller,"O Thou who heard the wailful plea
Of our forebears on bended knee,
And broke their bonds and set them free;
   To Thee we pray,
   To Thee we pray.

In broken word and wailing tone,
In deep, unutterable groan,
They made their tribulations known.
   Hear us, we pray,
   Hear us, we pray.

In this dark day of sore distress,
In deepest gloom of wilderness,
When threat'ning ills so hardly press;
   Help us this day,
   Help us this day.

If scorn and race disdain would seek
Its vial of wrath to venge and wreak
Upon this lowly folk and meek,
   Spare us, we pray,
   Spare us, we pray.

No people yet have fallen prey,
Who love Thy Law, walk in the way,
When all the world could look and say:
   ""Behold, they pray,
   ""Behold. they pray.""

But when we stray from Thy command.
And feel Thy sore afflicting hand,
We humbly bow; we understand,
   We must obey,
   We must obey.

If some Thy saving help deny,
With wild, inane, distracted cry,
Like Job's wild wife, would curse and die,
   Forgive, we pray,
   Forgive, we pray.

If time-taught wisdom nostrums find,
In cunning hand or knowing mind,
Show the blind leaders of the blind,
   'Tis vanity,
   'Tis vanity.

Thy righteous Law is all our trust,
Who builds on else but builds on dust;
The Mighty should, the Lowly must
   Rely alway,
   Rely alway.

And since of stones Thou raiseth seed
As choice as any boasted breed,
Vouchsafe to us the larger meal.

   We humbly pray.

To a Lady With Blue Eyes,Alice Ward Smith,Smith,"There's a pretty maid, but I'm afraid
   To give her name to you.
She makes great pets of violets
   Oh, would that she'd pet me, too!

Once in her youth, to tell you the truth,
   When the violets she tried to smell,
In some strange way, so sages say,
   In her eyes their colors fell.

And these colors have stayed, for they never fade,
   And when I saw her one time,
I straightway then just reached for my pen
   And tried to scribble a rhyme

But my consonents all went back on me
   Four vowels deserted too;
And since A, E, I, O, each went astray
   My heart is just filled up with U!

The Trial on Mount Olympus,George B. Thornton,Thornton,"I
It was on Mount Olympus, in a still hour of the night,
The gods were all assembled, and the moon shone full and bright;
The nightingales were singing gay with fond, full -throated ease,
On middle moonlight mounted and the lofty limbs of trees.
II
The liquid songs of music the nightly songsters made,
Filled all the air with melodies and floated down the glade:
But now they all are silenced, and such sober stillness falls
As haunts dead men's lifeless breast or pictures on the walls.
III
On that night Paul and Peter, two Apostles sacred came
To pass their judgment on the gods and persecute the same.
Around their heads were halos of a holy, splendid sheen,
Below, the gods assembled, awaiting dread were seen.
IV
And Peter motioned with his hand and forward Zeus came,
Full proud and brave of his renown and of his lasting fame;
But as he stood before the man that fished in Galilee,
He thought of titles he had lost-his high supremacy.
V
He raised his head in high disdain and anger fierce and dire,
His eyes shown as the lightnings, lcoking, acting, burning ire;
An' lightning 'gan to flash an' flame an' snap an' hiss an' roar,
An' all Olympus 'gan to shake as in the days of yore.

But Peter pressed the fiery bolts with light, unerring tread,
And turning to the ruler of this high Olympus, said:
""Thou art condemned an' cursed an' judged through all eternity!""
And Zeus vanished through the earth and said, ""Necessity!""
VII
Poseidon, strong and mighty, next approached the holy man,
With night depicted in his eyes, a trident in his hand.
""An' thou art he who rules the waves,"" gocd Peter angry spurned
Poseidon screamed with sudden pain an' into vapor turned.

Apollo and the muses nine behind him forward came,
As if in turn it was their time to register their name;
But wise Apollo turned to Paul and in a voice of dread,
Resembling wondrous music mixed with mighty murmurs, said:
IX
""I am the essence of the soul of sweet humanity,
The life an' health an' sportive youth of frolic gayety
Slay me not! Protect me, Lord, for 'twas ordained on high
That I be god of sacred song, and never, never die!""
X
The moment next of silence was when Peter raised his eyes,
(An' Paul was meditating , ) and he looked up to the skies.
The thoughtful Paul arose and said,"" This high behest I give,
Let Song immortal, sacred, free, henceforth forever live!""
XI
Apollo with his lute in hand sat on the earthly ground, [ around;
The night was clear, the fountains roared, and perfume smelled
The muses nine like sisters dear did gather in a ring,
An' tones of mighty minstrelsy they gan to gayly sing:

A Wise and Foolish Maid,James R. Tinus,Tinus,"Two maidens sat beside a brook,
And both were young and both were fair;
The rose vines, by the breezes shook,
Wafted a fragrance round them there.
They came each day to their secret bower,
And lived their lives like a summer flower.

Once, while talking of this and that,
In the deep shade of Nature's screen,
Two gorgeous birds flew in and sat
By the edge of this winding stream;
One maiden, clasping her hands in glee,
Cried: ""One for you, deary, and one for me.""

So running to the water's brink,
Each reached out for the prize so fair;
But alas! as quick as a wink
Away flew the birds through the air.
""I'll have you,"" cried one, ""sail high or low;""
The other said: ""I don't want you; go.""

So through the fields of ripening grain
Followed one maid; the bird a-wing,
Into the wood and out again,
Then far down where the marsh-reeds sing;
And as the bird circled its nest that night ,
It fell at the maiden's feet; dead from fright.

The bird to which the maid cried ""go.""
Not afraid of her gentle voice,
Piped a lay from the bush below,
And plucked her bits of plumage choice;
And then when it knew she would do no harm,
It flew to her bosom so fair and warm.

And so has love for all time been;
Be bold, and frighten him away;
If mild, you make a slave of him;
So maidens, list to what I say:
Don't chase after love, as the foolish do;
Be gentle and kind, and he'll come to you.

Chicamauga,H. Harrison Wayman,Wayman,"There is music in a cabin way down in Tennessee,
And there's a dusky hero in the Tenth Cavalry.
A littie pickaninny was scared almost to death,
And of a thousand troopers, most all held their breath,
On the field of Chickamauga, this little native strayed,
Where the government, in manoeuvers, its troopers had arrayed.
He was looking at the soldiers on the famous battlefield,
When he was seen a few yards off by the the Tenth as it swiftly reeled,
Of course you know they won't relent, when ordered to a charge,
Nor a child, unless by Providence, escapes a troop so large.
That Providence was in the Tenth 'mongst soldiers trained for strife,
It proved their training taught them save, as well as take a life.
A trooper spurred his steed just a litlle in advance,
As he muttered meekly and grabbed his only chance,
Then he just leaned in his saddle and gave a hasty scoop;
He saved the pickaninny, and his comrades gave a whoop.

Strength to Smile,Ethel Chestnutt Williams,Williams,"Bitter the wind, the path is rough,
Spent is my soul as I plod my mile;
I do not ask a smoother path,
Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.

Scarce is the wine, the fare is poor,
Athirst is my soul as I plod my mile:
I do not ask for flask or meat,
Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.

Heavy my load, the meed is small,
Weary my soul as I plod my mile:
I do not ask for rest or gold,
Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.

With strength to smile I'll keep the way,
And breast the storm as I plod my mile:

The Voice of the Negro ,(Anonymous),(Anonymous),"I hear a voice,--a plaintive, patient sound,
   A whisper low,
A murmur soft, steals all around,
   Heard oft before.

That sound, earth-born now rises to the skies,
   Fills all the air
With yearning to be heard that never dies,
   Goes everywhere.

Not from the beggars' idle task,
   It comes to you,
'Tis from the hearts of freemen--men who ask
   But Justice true.

That voice-soul cry of an awakening host
   Calls for its own,
It stalks right in like Banquo's ghost,
   Will not ""begone!""

Ye rulers of a state, did ye not hear
   His passive plea?
Wilt turn deaf ear to plaintive prayer,
   Which calls to thee?

Oh! Nation great--let memory bear thee back
   To earlier days
When struggled thou on war's relentless rack,
   In fearful phase.

In those dark days, when in the balance hung
   The fair young life
Thy honor, by this voice not once was stung
   With treason's rife.

The owner of that voice, thy armies fed,
   He toiled for thee
On countless fields of war he fought and bled,
   'Till thou wert free.

When slavers base, with thy permission made
   His life a hell,
This voice was never heard thee to upbraid,
   It wished thee well.

O country proud--with undying boast
   Of Liberty,
Wilt thou, with thy victorious vaunting host,
   An ingrate be?

I dreamed long since that voice had lost its tone
   Of beggars' plea,
And in my sleep me thought that voice did scorn
   To not be free.

I heard once more its stirring sounds again,
   Its summons grand,
Its call brought forth ten thousand black-faced men
   At its command.

It begged no more, but sounded in its power,
   O'er all the earth,
And bondsmen hailed the crucial hour
   Of Freedom's birth.

The Summons,John Henry Adams,Adams,"Why stand ye there face down, strong man?
Lamenting o'er the years thou'st spent
Inserving paler men their plan; 
In paying meaner men their rent; 
In hiring weaker men thy arm;
Those men who send abroad alarm
The danger thou dost threaten them 
Of equal craving for the light
To see the wrong, its tide to stem ,
To live a man and wield thy might?

Lament not o'er the time thou'st lost 
In loving men who show their hate
For thee and thine,and keep the cost
Of friendship where to reach the rate
Thou must unman thyself of thought
And hope and pride, of ideals wrought
Soul deep byloving angels touch. 
They may all go the truth to give:
Both they and it are not worth much 
Compared with God and life to live.

In thee is ev'ry function right 
Of head and heart and hand; 'tis true!
Confide to them thy will, and blight
The source which holds to thee the View
Of endless serfdom for thy years.
Lament no more! Clear up thy tears!
Lift up thy drooping form and head!

To work. Thy friends are all not dead.

The Awakening,John Henry Adams,Adams,"Thou Black, with matchless strength, wake up!
These years of untold schemes to keep
Thee drinking bitters from the cup
Of Servitude, and thus to sleep,
Have kept thy soul and mighty brain
From joining in life's sweet refrain.
Wake up!

Look to the light beyond the hills
Bright shining in resplendent hues;
Look to the mighty deed that stills
The wailing of the Russian Jews;
Look high to God, the Prince of Peace
Who speaks, and men their warfares cease.
Look up!

Enter thy protests full and strong
'Gainst those whose hands thy treasure rob
'Gainst those who bind thee down by wrong
And in their mean enslaving orb
Consign thee to a place with herd.
Assert thyself! Speak out thy word!
Contend!

By that which others make the goal,
You're made: gold, land, and learning true,
A loving heart, a quickeu'd soul,
The earth a full commanding view.
Wake up! Look up! And, hard contend
For that the ages cannot rend.
And live.

The Knocker,Matthew D. Bennett,Bennett,"WHEN a man who is married stays out half the night
And gambles and drinks and looks for fight,
Then goes home to wifie, all cross and black,--
At the least provocation he gives her a smack,

And she with her children don't know what to do,

Goes out every night, with some maiden petite,

When board bill, house rent and other things are due,
And he loses his job in the Winter time, too,

Who has flooded his Bible with fervent tears,
Who never gave an instructive talk, but dwelt at length on ""how to walk;""
Who scoffs at the young folks ' progressive ideas
And holds the old ""fogies"" in superstitious fears--
Who goo goos at the best looking sisters in the church
And yet tells them to live right or they'll be left in the ""lurch""

Who has no taste for literature or things which are refined,
Nor cares for culture, or progress, or nothing of the kind,
Nor knows the care of children, nor how to raise them right,
But takes delight in tattling and figuring in a fight,
Whose only aim in life is to raise a hullabaloo,

Yule-Song: A Memory,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"December comes, snows come,
   Comes the wintry weather;
Faces from away come
   Hearts must be together.
      Down the stair- steps ofthe hours
      Yule leaps the hills and towers
   Fill the bowl and hang the holly,
   Let the times be jolly.

Day comes, and night comes
   And the guests assemble
Once again the old dream comes
  That I would dissemble,
      Falls a shadow 'cross the floor,
      Seen!-and is seen no more.
   O that memory would forego
   The hanging of the mistletoe.

After the years of waiting and the pain,
After the striving and the stress thou'rt gone!
After the pulsing heart-throb and the fret,
The quick reward, the sudden voice of fame,
The noisy clamor of a great world's praise,
The great far-sight into the heart of things,
Thou'rt gone, and wilt be with us here no more.
We loved thee, brother, in this nether light,
With hearts more full of love than we did dream;
We loved thy voice, thy work, they heart, thy hope,
Thy aspiration and enlightened view,
We loved thee in the darkness of the year
When thou didst tread the borderland of death;
And love thee now with that far greater love
That beckons us to thy eternal light.
And when in some far-off hereafter day
The voice of Fame shall speak her last decree,
When she shall summon from the wreck of worlds
The names that Time's great movement shall defeat,
And when then she shall stand beside thy tomb,

That I should ever love you-- didnot dream
that by and by I should unhappy deem
Each day that brough no message to my ear;

To all that pained me that it did not seem
That sometime in the after years the gleam
That comes with love would bid me have no fear;
But all those days are over and are gone;
Above them rests the Never-Nevermore;

For bread, comes up before me with its pain;
Then all the raging madness and the fret

Comes back with all its bitterness, and yet--

Lucinda Totten,C. Morton Brown,Brown,"Once there lived three common people
In a log hut with no steeple
   A colored man, his wife and little girl;
The mother first departed,
And she left them broken hearted,
   While their brains were reeling in a dizzy whirl.

And next old Father Totten,
Whose hair was white as cotton,
   And who had served for three score years a slave,
Went away and left Lucinda
And may the gods defend her,
   While her father lies a-sleeping in his grave.

So those humble old-time people,
Whose hut was void of steeple,
   Left ""Cindy"" there to labor and to moan:
To plant the corn and cotton
Near the log hut that was rotten,
   Till she became a woman fully grown.

Her parents they had taught her
To cook, and to bring the water
   From nature's little spring beneath the hill:
To labor late and early,
With no trace of being surly,
   And bring home sacks of white meal from the mill.

This girl who was not charming
Gave all her time to farming,
   And learned the art of how to sow and reap;
Her faithfulness to duty
Made up her loss of beauty,
   And gained for her such friends as she could keep.

Lucinda did the ditching,
She scrubbed -she did the stitching,
   And had to drive the mules and haul the wood;
And she was always ready,
With patient hand and steady,
   To help the folks in all the neighborhood.

It must not be forgotten
That beside the corn and cotton
   She had a score of beehives on a shelf.
She sold the wax and honey,
Which brought her lots of money
   And added quite a good deal to her pelf.

It was this Lucinda Totten,
Who hoed the corn and cotton,
   While living in a log hut all alone,
Who saved up every penny
Till she acquired so many
   She bought a little cottage of her own.

So now adieu, Miss Totten,
You'll never be forgotten
   By friends who have a knowledge of your fame;
You'll be loved by many neighbors
Who will always praise your labors
   While the title of this song shall bear your name.",May,1906,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,"Labor, Slavery",,Atlanta,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Gate of Nevermore,Simson Oliver Clayton,Clayton,"All things of earth may soon or late
Pass quietly through an open gate
         Called Nevermore;
And back again there's no return,
Although our hearts do often yearn
To clasp some dear one, loved and true,
Who has that mystic gate passed through,
Adown this weary vale of tears,
And heeding not the months and years,
Earth and its fulness rush right on,
Pass through and are forever gone.

At morn we laugh and joke and prate,
And think not of the sombre gate
         Called Nevermore;
But, 'ere the evening shadows fall,
Through tears we view the funeral pall
Of one who sang his sweet, sweet lay
From eerly morn till the close of day;
And he who sang to us of yore
Goes on as others did before
Has done what each of us must do:
The gate of Nevermore passed through.

But who is this gifted one so dear,
Whose song of the weary heart bring cheer
         Forevermore?

Paul Dunbar, who from heaven doth shine
Upon your pathway and on mine.
Though gone a higher sphere to fill,
His echoing lyrics vibrate still
And generations yet unknown
Shall reap the sweetness he has sown,
For glory opened wide the door
When he passed through the gate called Nevermore!

Atlanta's Shame,Carrie Williams Clifford,Clifford,"In queenly state she sits at the gateway of the South —
   And lifts with conscious pride her stately head :
Fair Atlanta feels her worth, and her children are elate,
   As thro' her streets they go with happy tread.
She has sons of many kinds, she has sons of many hues,
   And she says she cares for all, but this we know,
Tho' she exacts of each alike service, revenue, respect,
   The blacks get of her favor but scant show!
Yet the harder do they strive her good will and grace to win.
   Keeping step with progress — forward without pause!
Gaining knowledge, getting wealth, doing all things duly meet.
   Hoping thus to gain Atlanta's prized applause.
But alas! 'tis all in vain, for she hates with bitter hate
   These poor blacks who aye remind her of her shames;
Of her greed for wealth and power, of her base consuming lust:
   Noble striving but the more her wrath inflames.
Then to hide from honest eyes her blood-guiltiness and sin,
   She most cunningly contrives a wicked plot —
Subtly spoken a base word, then this cry against the blacks
   Cleaves the night ! ""Revenge! lynch, slaughter and spare not!""
Three awful nights she reveled in a carnival of crime,
   Three days or e'er the tension was relieved;
When her thirst for blood was sated, the whole nation stood aghast.
   Her cry of ""Rape,"" no more the world deceived!
Lamentations, bitter sobs, heart-wrung groans the soft winds bore
   Thro' the streets where lay the victims of her rage;
Helpless age and guiltless youth, innocence and trusting truth —
   It had taken all, her fury to assuage.
Dread Atlanta nevermore can the crimson stain erase,
   Nor the foul blot wipe from off fair history's scroll ;
This fell deed shall e'er arise, ghost-like from the mists of time
   To confront and terrify her guilty soul!",November,1906,Voice of the Negro,J. Max Barber,,female,Lynching-and-Racialized-Violence,"Voice of the Negro (January 1907), Race Rhymes (1911)",Chicago,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Williams_Clifford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tribute to Paul Laurence Dunbar,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"There came a dark youth singing in the dawn
Of a new freedom, to a mellow lyre,
Refining, as with touch of an Apollo's fire,
The songs a lowly people sang upon
A toilsome way. The night of gloom was gone;
He stood, full-throated, cheering son and sire
To garner grain, despising rain and mire
Of yesternight. ""To-day,"" he sang, ""toil on
And up, my race, from vale toward glory's crest!""
Men marvelled at the singer, strong and sweet.
He left the forest, drenched with storms of night,

Grant and Lee,Joseph S. Cotter,Cotter,"The South's the sin? The North's the glory?
Laugh out of court the hackneyed story.
The sin took root in the nation's heart
And North and South played a dual part.

The North and the South wore a cheek of shame,
Till a life of woe wrought an earth of flame.
And who were the heroes? All who fell,
Whether North or South in the nation's hell.

And who were the heroes? Great souls who fed
The nations's maw with the nation's dead
Till the nation's blood slew the nation's curse
And made man free as the universe.

Neither Grant of the North nor Lee of the South
Shall link his name with the cannon's mouth,
Neither Lee of the South nor Grant of the North
Shall stand accused when the blame goes forth.

In the South's warm heart, on the North's just tongue,
A dual epic of peace is sung,
With regret for the bond and hope for the free
And a God-like love for Grant and Lee.

A Sigh For Rest,Alice H. Cunningham,Cunningham,"World-tired, I trudge my onward way
O'er the same drear path from day to day;
There seems no hope, like some guiding star,
To shine down upon me from afar.

Man-tired, I long for a forest wild
Where Nature and I may roam, undefiled
By humans and their doubts and woes---
For some glad spot where the river flows.

Gold-tired --- and oh! for some happy land
Where you're paid for a deed by a friendly hand
Where glitter and gold are mere paltry things
And gold and gain are not worshipped as kings.

Life-tired, I long for the restful end,
But my soul still under its load must bend;
Death holds aloft, he will not come nigh,
Though I crave and pray for the right to die.",February,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such chances, such abilities, to see the end was not for my poor eyes,
   Thine was the impulse, thine for forming thought.
I have wrought,
   And these sad hands have right to tell their story.
It was no hard up-striving after glory,
   Catching and losing, gaining and failing,
Raging me back at the world's raucous railing.
   Simply and humbly from stone and from wood,
Wrought I the things that to thee might seem good.

The Colored Soldiers,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"If the muse were mine to tempt it
   And my feeble voice were strong,
If my tongue were trained to measures,
   I would sing a stirring song.
I would sing a song heroic
   Of those noble sons of Ham,
Of the gallant colored soldiers
   Who fought for Uncle Sam!

In the early days you scorned them,
   And with many a flip and flout,
Said ""these battles are the white man's
   And the whites will fight them out.""
Up the hills you fought and faltered,
   In the vales you strove and bled,
While your ears still heard the thunder
   Of the foes' increasing tread.

Then distress fell on the nation
   And the flag was drooping low;
Should the dust pollute your banner?
   No! the nation shouted, No!
So when war, in savage triumph,
   Spread abroad his funeral pall--
Then you called the colored soldiers,
   And they answered to your call.

And like hounds unleashed and eager
   For the life blood of the prey,
Sprung they forth and bore them bravely
   In the thickest of the fray.
And where'er the fight was hottest,--
   Where the bullets fastest fell,
There they pressed unblanched and fearless
   At the very mouth of hell.",December,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,"Civil War, Patriotism",Majors and Minors,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comrades,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"Come, list to my song of the comrades,
Scattered the world around—-
The good men and the true men
In the brotherhood army found.

Be they white or black or red men,
The shade of the skin is naught;
True greatness is counted by heart-beats,
True manhood is measured by thought.

Among them the highest is servant,
The highest is that one who pays
In deeds of love and mercy
His vows through all the days.

Among them the one rule is justice,
And upon the old ladder of fame
Each round belongs to the brother
Who first puts his foot on the same.

They are lifters and helpers, not leaners;
They are willing whenever they can
To give a hand to the fallen
And aid to a brother -man.

The sweep of the seas may divide them,
Yet their good deeds have made them agirth,
And like rays of sunlight their blessings
Reach the uttermost ends of the earth.

Shoulder to shoulder they march them,
To-day as in the days of yore—-
The call of the past behind them,
The call of the future before.

The call of the present is urgent
For men of leading and light,
Who are ready to march with these comrades
And strengthen their hands in the fight.

There are other fields to conquer,
And other heights to attain
The brotherhood army is sweeping
O'er mountain and sea and plain.

Oh, heed it, and join the great army!
Men of all colors fall in!
And help your advancing comrades
Eternal honors to win!

For comrades they are--ay, comrades!
All the wide world around,
The good men and the true men
In the brotherhood army found.

The Poet and His Song,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"Give me a corner in some lone hut,
Or a place in the woods by a stream,
And leave me there to sing my song
And in mystic fancies dream.

Therein I find my sweetest joy,
Singing aloud to myself;
Let the world wag on -- I sing my song,
Unmoved by its praise or its pelf.

My singing would lose its charm for me, 
If my purse instead of my heart
Dictated the measures that I lisp
To suit the broker's mart.

I put the world beneath my feet.
With all that it can grant,
When all alone in aquiet nook
My heavenly song I chant.

He misses the whole of the poet's art
Who does not sing from within,
And is not hampered one moment by
The world's incongruous din.

For surely 'tis true, when forth from the heart
Impassioned lyrics roll
Through all the years the music's heard,
Pealing from soul to soul.

And hereby we know the immortal band
And the bard of one short day --
The song of the first springs out of his heart,
While the other one sings for pay.

Requiem Dirge for Atlanta's Slain,George W. Forbes,Forbes,"And we laid 'em slowly 'neath a nameless mound,
As the Autumn leaves serenely were descending,
And sad and silent there were gathered round
The reft ones who with sorrowing were bending.

Not there from restless nights of fevered pain
That proffer death as life's surcease from sorrow;
But void of wrongs these cruelly were slain
Amid their struggles for bread on the morrow.

Whatever your misfortune, theirs was worse,
For they knew not its plotting, or their crime;
But fell a holocaust to color's curse,
While duty-bent they labored in their prime.

And they toiled duty-bent for this reward:
""No quarters to those whom the State disowns;""
The stars and stripes, that should them shield afford,
Now pirate's emblem with its skull and bones.

Haughtily speak they of the murdered dead,
Not deeming them worth more than passing mention;
Yet Sampson's Temple on his captor's head
'Mid mocking thundered down an inattention.

God of our fathers through their darkest way,
Thou who proud nations humblest in their might,
Are these those gloomiest hours ere breaking day,
Or gathering storms that usher in the night?

Thy will done, O Lord; and not too long
Withhold us justice: on our darkened road
Be Thou our light, else from long years of wrong
We give way under life's augmenting load.

Calmly we laid them 'neath the dewy sod
Where the Morn's waking clarion shall find them;
In love for country, and faith in their God
They filled the humble duties He assigned them.

The Pyramids,T. Thomas Fortune,Fortune,"Upon the future life we build,
As built the toilers of the Nile,
Whose rude and ruthless tyrants willed
That God's eternal sun should smile.

On monuments of dust and stone
Which should defy the flight of Time,
Beneath dumb hieroglyphics groan,
The wonder of each age and clime!

And still they stand, in Winter's storms
And vernal Summer's rays benign,
Lifting on high grand, gloomy forms
Round which eternity may twine!

The Pyramids! When did they rear
Their sombre bulk to Time's stern gaze?
Caust estimate the thought -the care
The lives condemned---the flight of days---

That went to consecrate the pile
Where Egypt's tyrants now repose,
The sentient serpents of the Nile,
At whose command the phantoms rose?

Each stons cemented with the gore,
The tears and sweat of some poor slave!
For each dead king the millions bore
Into the gloomy vaults, his grave,

A thousand men, perchance, had bled,
Had sacrificed their all in death,
To guard the tyrant in his bed
And watch for his returning breath!

No faith can make the hidden mysteries clear
That shroud the glories of the Eden where
Our hopes, through all the ages, circle 'round,

We fondly deem we know from whence we came,
And to what destiny at last shall go,
When vanish all of pomp and power and fame:

The giant stands disclosed in matchless power.

Pendant like gorgeous floating muslin shrouds,
Charm and o'erawe the soul that looks to God
Who dwells in skies, in peaks afar, in sod
And feels the force that made the prophets rear
Their sacred altars in the upper air.

The soul will lift itself above the clay
And seek beyond the earth eternal day.
And never can the man who once has seen
Unveiled the myst'ries of the mountain's sheen,
Its vastness and its strength and rugged brow,
Feel as he felt before , content to dwell
Cooped in the confines of his native cell.

Yet, judged by the past, it is safe to suppose,
""Twill the same old tales repeat.""

Lines to the New Congressional Library,Maxwell Hayson,Hayson,"Oh! mighty edifice of quarried stone,
What sacred treasures numberless are thine.
There seeks his level on the sheeted dome,
The lavished glory of a nation strong,
The golden sun in central lucent bloom.
In simple wonder in his fertile fields
Along suburban banks of flowing streams,
And driving cityward his laboring team,
The farmer this majestic structure sees
Abundant with the toil of vanished years.
Those men who wrote, unconscious of their fame,
In this new world review the home of man
Again in peaceful bust on honored throng;
Lo! Dante from a quiet granite nook
His silent glance cast on the open world,
As if to breathe upon his slumbering time,
The life and spirit of these alien days;
Amid impressive chimes of noonday bells,
Which bring melodiously on iron tongues
An incantation as the thoughts rove back.
Huge Neptune, stern in mythological calm,
The towering symbol to the fountain place,
And everywhere displayed by hand of art,
The emblematic good of knowledge great,
Too, all the lovely forms of fabled realms.
Within the reader's marble-circled room,
The vivid light from heaven soften'd is,
And in the lucid mellowness is seen,
Complacent in the burnished tranquil bronze,
The peerless image of the old Shakespeare wise,
With all his lofty compeers gathered 'round.
A splendid palace for the living dead!
Ah! but the period now distant will exist,
When the owl's doubly melancholy song
Among the mellow archives shall resound
Prolific with the notes of grand decay
And through the darksome passages shall flow
In many a silent beam, the silver flood
From Cynthia's high roving ancient keep.
Ah! now for some enchanted Byron's pen
On this as on the Coliseum scene,
To trace another few immortal lines;
Then generations, yet unborn will view
In mouldering and gray magnificence
The crowning labor of a sleeping age.

In March,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"The last chill wind brought snow and ice and sleet;
Like Christmas trees a dawn from Christmas night
The forest were a wreath of silvern white;
At morn the sun burst full with glimmering heat,
The South wind waft, across the greening wheat,
A robin's note to cheer my heart's dim night;
Borne back to answer him my soul's first flight
This tribute to his vernal song's high beat:
Didst thou from Hope's high minaret foresee
Wild March with sheeted, icy hands of storm
Would wake the trees and set the sap-life free?
The faith of thy frail song-insistent, clear,
Though faltering notes, hath made the day less drear.",March,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/charles-bertram-johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To an Oak,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Oh, oak! long years the stress of storm and wind
Has made thy limbs exult in growing thew;
And deeper , surer in the earth descend
The thousand tenderils that were strengthening you;
With best of sun and song and rain and dew
High on the hill thy strength, tho storm and wind
Oft did thy tender thewless youth unbend;
But greater thou in limb and power grew.
Oh, mighty oak! with faith serene and sure,
Impart to me the secret of thy girth,
Invest me master of thy patient will;
That through the coming years I may endure,
And deeper rooted in the fields of earth,
At last, as thou, be sovereign of a hill.",April,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/charles-bertram-johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Larger Life,Charles Bertram Johnson,Johnson,"Give me a heart made brave and strong
A life lived sweet in sorrow's hour,
A living Faith serene in song,
And noble love's diviner power;
Let smiles break swift on frown or tears,
And peace be happy dove in strife;
I have but once to live my years,
'Twere good I live a larger life.

Give me sweet faith in other men;
My life is stronger when I trust;
I wish to love them , tho ' they sin,
And help them live , because I must.
My life is bound at every turn
In common interest with the good
Of other lives ; and tho' I yearn
For trust, I'll give the trust I should.

I wish to grow in mind and heart,
To live each day on thought's high plain
Full conscious of life's nobler part
Full conscious of life's highest gain;
So live to-day to-morrow's sun
Will rise in glory's crown arrayed,
Upon no duty left undone,
Or sacrifice I should have made.

Each day is link in life's long chain,
And weak or strong as we shall live;
The whole's not stronger 'neath the strain,
Than strength the weakest link can give,
Each day I'll live as tho ' my last,
As tho ' before me was unrolled
The future , present and the past
My whole life's good upon a scroll.

And writ in gold my days of good ,
Tho' blank the leaves of idle years ,
I oft may read in solitude
How much was wrought by contrite fears—
How much by sincere sympathies
The crust I shared, the trust I gave,
The hope inspired -felicities
That made a sad heart light and brave.

I shall not live a mussel-shell;
My heart shut fast against the world;
Nor live where others cannot dwell
Ensphered too high above the whirl,
And busy life of men who toil;
But close where break the cries of strife:---
Some lower plain anear the soil---
I'll live out full a larger life.",May,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/charles-bertram-johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supplication,D.J. Jordan,Jordan,"O thou who ruleth all,
At thy footsteps I fall;
Hear thou me when I call,--

Thou art my only stay,
Thou wilt not say me nay,
Lead thou me all the way,
   In Thee I trust.

I would thy name adore,
I long to love Thee more,

Grant both to serve and love,
As angels do above;
Descend, O heavenly Dove,

Bouquet Charlie,Lida Keck-Wiggins,Keck-Wiggins,"Poor and black is ""Bouquet Charlie.""

Nothing very strange about him,
Save the story that they tell
Of his always wearing flowers
In his shabby coat lapel .

Tell me why from day to day
Never have I failed to find you
With a button-hole bouquet?""

To the Discharged Soldiers,Margaret P. Lorick,Lorick,"The winter winds are blowing,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
And the angry sea is flowing
Soldiers true;
They are telling of your pride;
There is naught for you to hide,
For the right is on your side,
Soldiers true!

The stars are shining brightly,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
They are dancing rather sprightly,
Soldiers true;
And they say you are not to blame
If you did not know the name,
And they love you just the same,
Soldiers true!

The moonbeams now are dancing,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
They are darting and a-glancing,
Soldiers true;
They are watching now to see
What your final fate will be,
When the truth gains potency,—
Soldiers true!

I hear dry leaves rushing,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
And the winds again are rushing,
Soldiers true;
They know you've done no wrong
And they sing a joyous song,
And they sing it loud and long,—
Soldiers true!

If you've done no sinful deed,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
To grieve, you have no need,
Soldiers true;
So you must not hide your face,
Although you've lost your place,
You are not in deep disgrace,
Soldiers true.

The ""Christmas Bells "" are ringing,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
And the angels softly singing,
Soldiers true;
They seem to call your name,
Saying ""Isn't it a shame,
That all should bear the blame,""
Soldiers true.

The clouds are drifting high,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
They seem to touch the sky,
Soldiers true;
And they tell it o'er and o'er
That you will go back once more
To the place you had of yore,
Soldiers true.

God's great Flag of Truth is flying,
Soldiers true, soldiers true,
High above the white man's lying,
Soldiers true.
Lift your eyes and see it there,
Waving in the upper air;
Up and throw away despair,--
Soldiers true!

The Curse of Gold,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The ring of gold through centuries re-echoes,
The air is pregnant with its clanking din,
'Tis worshipped now as when the proud patrician
   Reveled in sin.

Men have been known to slaughter fellow-brothers
To deal in deeds of death with daring bold,
And purest lives marred by unholy vices
   For sake of gold.

The miser sits within his lowly dwelling,
And counts in silence there his hoarded gold;
No lesson unto man of love or duty
   His lips unfold.

Within the monastery's secret cloisters
Where dwells the monk with humbleness profound
Or where the chiming convent bells are ringing
   There gold is found.

Deep in the cold, cold grave where all is silent
Where mighty Death his wondrous change hath wrought,
'Tis there desires of earth are all forgotten
   No gold is sought.

A Recollection of Easter,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"I heard a sweet and gladsome lay
From out the forest deep;
'Twas ere the glory of the day
Had kissed the stars to sleep.

The organ tones, the chanting choir.
Pealed forth on Easter tide;
My soul was filled with Heavenly fire
The earth was beautified.

The gentle breezes catch the strains
And bear them all away;
Just as a shadow ne'er remains
But passes with the day.

Ye gentle zephyrs that have heard
In fane and greenwood tree,
The songs of choir and minstrel bird,
Oh! bear them back to me.

I shall not hear the music roll
On some glad Easter day,
For zephyrs soft shall take my soul
And bear it far away.

   I think of thee;
When all is still, save song bird's call 
   I think of thee.
The moon looks down and seems to smile,
And bright stars twinkle all the while.

While evening breezes round me blow,
   I think of thee.
When western sky is all aglow 
   I think of thee.
A gentle voice doth seem to say:
""Sigh not; await the coming day.""

The Sun and the Storm King,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The Sun flared up in the eastern hills
   And tore the shroud of night,
The faithful guards at peep of day,
Their blushing faces hid away
   From that transcendent light.

From out his scabbard worn and old
   The Storm King drew his blade;
He blew his war horu loud and clear
And rent the silence far and near ---
   His angry host obeyed.

Thus while the day wept, dull and gray,
   That Vandals held her king;
The piercing flash from each shining blade
With the rapid rumbling their laughter made.
   Told of their revelling.

The Sun, when the Day was growing old,
   Was nearing Evening's door,
Then flung the Storm King over his crest
Who hied away to the Ocean's breast,
  The Sun was King once more.

What if the way be rough and hard
Sometime will come a brighter day,
Hope bringeth joy: this way, this way.

Hope will not leave thee all alone.

The all that gives me greater will,
And bids me to be still, be still.

Rock-a-bye, baby, soon labor will call
   Call me away from thee;

Mystery,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"From out the Mystic somewhere, yet unknown,
I came a stranger here, unmasked, to plan
My journey in this life, a fleeting span,
Ushered by Cosmic Law, I came alone.
And fleeting years had passed before I knew
I was; though mysteries surround me, like shroud,
I wondered not whence came a star or cloud
Or who had painted heaven a changeless blue.
Before I left my home in distant clime,
Stern Destiny had marked my humble lot.
Helpless am I, past life and form forgot,
I am an infant in the lap of Time.
The stars light worlds in God's vast firmament
That spin with rapid rate through boundless space.
All, all the universe moves on apace
Around some unseen star omnipotent.
When I have stepped on board each drifting ship
Within the fleet of planets and of stars
Sailing toward that star past earthly bars,
My journey will my waiting soul equip.
Into the mystic somewhere yet unknown,
I go some day to know another plan,
When all is ended in this fleeting span
Impelled by Cosmic Law, I go alone.

A Protest,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"Ye who would stop the progress of a race,
Give ear; that race would question thee. 
So base a deed as thine belies the name of man.
This bickering that comes 'twixt clan and clan,
Let Justice rule and prejudice erase.
Ye call us enemies of thine to-day,
But when the cannon sounded far away
Calling thy fathers to the battle's din,
This enemy upon thy threshold lay
The watch dog, lest a foe should enter in.
A friend or foe was he to thee and thine?
This upward movement of a mighty host
Is ever onward still. Like Banquo's ghost

They will not down, whatever you design
To bruise and crush it with thy tyrant heel.
The day is past when we knew but to kneel.
Lost is thy purpose, as the wild bird's cry
Within a storm. Its shriek is never heard
Above the mutterings of the thunder's roar,
Though Truth and Right upon the altar lie
To see them cricified our hearts are stirred
This sacrifice but makes Ambition soar
To loftier heights, and we commit our plan
To Him who better knows each struggling clan,
To Him who rightly judges man and man.

The Little Maiden's Curse,J. Frederick Matthews,Matthews,"What made the pale-faced father frown
And drive the girl away,
When she had come in childish glee
With his own sweet girl to play?

""Oh, papa, dear; do let her stay!""
His little daughter cried.
""Ah, no, my child!"" the father said,
And quickly turned aside.

What made the father say in scorn,
With a look that seemed so wild,
""That Thing's not fit to play with you,
My darling little child?""

'Twas only the color of her skin
That brought forth the father's scorn:
'Twas only because God made her black
The day when she was born.

O, Father of Heaven and of Love,
Will the angels say, ""Go back?""
Will they drive her away from the golden gate
Because forsooth she's black?

Autumn,James Edward McCall,McCall,"There comes each year a season drear
Which with its frosty breath
Doth sing unto the saddened world
The monrnful song of Death.

It slays the fair and fragrant lowers
And drives the birds away
To warmer climes, 'neath distant skies,
Where all is bright and gay.

Upon the meadow's verdant for
Itlays acarpet brown;
And from the sighing, frost-kissed trees
It blows the dead leaves down.

It whistles through the naked woods.
In notes both fierce and shrill.
Which echo and reverberate
From valley, glade and hill.

The tender-hearted wint'ry clouds
Shed cold tear drops of rain,
As they behold the sad ,sad earth
O'er which fair flowers lie slain.

And as in pain and grief we view
Chilled Nature's gloomy face.
Thoughts ofthe grave file through our souls
In swift and breathless pace.

We think of dear departed friends
Gone to that other land;
And sigh to contemplate the hour
When we must cross Death's strand.

But why should we thus quake with fear
At thought of that last day?
Twere' better that we should bedeck
Our souls in pure array.",October,1906,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/james-edward-mccall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By thy aid the weary soul
Glimpses its celestial goal.

When the soul doth faint and sadden,
Flowers purify and gladden:
Poetry fresh vigor rings;
And sweet music giveth wings.

And from trouble's dark dominions,
With delight and rapture soars
Straight to heaven's pearly doors.

What would Life to mortals be,
Were their lives bereft of thee?

Over scenes of grief and sorrow,
Anguish , deep despair and horror,
Thou dost shed a beam so bright,
That the darkness turns to light.

Even savage hearts beat faster,
And acknowledge God as Master,
When they hear thee in sweet speech,
Of the great Creator teach.

And in thee doth find no pleasure,
Worships sin and vice instead,
And his soul is truly dead.

In forced to look serene and calm, although

"Not Why, O Lord, But Help",Ann Melody,Melody,"Not why a few black men in bondage sold,
Did multiply like Israel did of old,
   When pressed by lash and toil;
Nor why their children, who are slaves no more,
By prejudice are bound in bondage sore
   And ground down to the soil;

Not Why, O Lord, But Help
Not why Thy will didst carve in ebony
Thy same great Image blessed by Trinity,
   As Thou in marble white;
Nor why man's will by laws and creeds decree
The lowest grade our blest estate to be;
   His mandates, our delight;

Not why one father's children are close kin;
Nor why the fruitage of a father's sin
   Set children's teeth on edge;
Nor why God given rights of Liberty
For sons of Ham an awful curse should be,
   But Japheth's privilege;

Not why, O Lord, we do not ask Thee why;
We humbly seek thy aid or else we die.
   Not why, O Lord, but help.
The surging tide of prejudice is strong
And sweeps our stanchest earthly friends along.
   Not why, O Lord, but help.

O'erhead the inky clouds obscure the sun,
And angry winds doth drive the tempest on,
   And heavy runs the sea;
O Christ! if we but scan the troubled sea,
We sink as Peter did in Galilee:
   O bid us come to Thee!

Speak Thou unto the turbid waves of strife,
Wrath-crowned and swift to stifle out our life;
   O bid the sea be still!
Bid Thou the winds to rein their chargers in
And cease their raids which aid the cause of sin;
   O bid them do Thy will!

All power is Thine in Heaven and Earth;
The wrath and might of men is but Thy mirth,
   For Thou hast made them all.
Therefore we trust not human help nor creeds,
We humbly seek the mighty power that heeds
   The smallest sparrow's fall.

Not why, O Lord, we would not ask of Thee
For Thou who bared Thine arm to make us free
   Wilt not Thine own forsake;
But help, we plead, O Lord and that Thy might
Wilt lead us through this wilderness and night
   And cause our day to break.

"And This, the White Man's Burden",J. N. Samuels-Belborder,Samuels-Belboder,"WE hear of divers sayings,
Read proverbs full of truth;
To greatest age we hear them,
From adolescent youth.

But that which shames all knowledge,
And Reason doth impeach,
Is this: ""The white man's burden,""
Which o'er the world they preach.

Boasting of Christian goodness,
Of Law and Equity,
They fail to live their learning
Of Moral probity.

From glutted town and province
Where fortunes are denied,
They sail the wide, wide ocean,
Till they our shores have spied.

Thither they head: and landing
With strange timidity,
Receive our native kindness
And hospitality.

Returning with the presents
Of gold and priceless
They call our lands benighted,
And would their depths explore.

Our lands of dual greatness,
Fertility and gold;—
They confiscate and claim them
With lying tongues so bold.

Their doctrines then, they teach us,
Which eager we imbibe;
But find them inconsistent,
And shameful to our tribe.

They rob our gold and diamonds,
With arms' defying power;
And to our greatest sorrow,
Our virgins they deflower.

And this, ""the white man's burden!""
To plunder, kill, deflower!
Lay waste our Native glory,
And falsely it endower!

Is this the heavy ""burden""
Throughout the world we hear?
Aye! this the boasted ""burden""

Contaminate our ear;
Such arrant blatant boastings
We hear from year to year!

And yet we hear them calmly,
Resigning all our fate,
To that great Power and Spirit,
Who Times and men placate.

Ye sons of Ethiopia,
Less boastful nations, all--
Courage! for soon such ""greatness""
Will totter, reel, and fall.

Ye Presidents and Princes,
Who guide the stately helms,
Kings of great tribes and peoples,
Throughout the world -wide realms,

Behold the rank injustice
To Ethiop's ebon sons;
The lash, the whip, the wailings,
The very blood that runs!

And this, ""the white man's burden!""--
To plunder, kill, deflower!
Lay waste our Native glory,
And falsely it endower.

La Response,Alice Ward Smith,Smith,"Saint Valentine knocked at my door this morning.

A Callin' Home the Cows,Alice Ward Smith,Smith,"When the shades o' night are fallin'
An' the sun has gone to rest,
When the wee young birds are cuddled
In the soft warm nest,

I love to saunter down the lane,
An' loiter on the bars,
An' look out o'er the gloomin'
For the comin' o' the stars.

'Cause just across from where I watch
Echoing thru the pine tree boughs 
I can hear sweet Nellie Master's voice
A callin home the cows.

There's a band o' music down in town
The sound comes way out here;
Sister Mandy's playin' somethin'
On the organ sweet and clear

There's a mocking bird a singin'
In the tree out there,
The brook's a gurglin' soft and low
But I don't care.

All I want to hear is that sweet voice
A echoin' thru the boughs,
Pretty Nellie Master's voice 
'A callin' home the cows.

Mother says she's been a callin' me
To bring her up some wood,
Says she don't know what come over me,
I've always been so good.

'Bout hearin'. But I just can't hear everything
Around that bloomin' house,
'Specially when the neighbors
Are 'a callin home the cows.

My Little Daughter,Sarah S. Stewart,Stewart,"When the evening shadows fall
Darkly over the crowded street ,
From the nursery , through the hall ,
Comes the sound of little feet.
Sweet the hour at close of day ,
When my baby comes to me,
Putting all her toys away ,
Climbing eager to my knee .
Presses tender lips to mine ,
Nestles fondly on my breast ;
Loving arms about me twine ---
How she loves to be caress'd !
Little hands so warm and soft ;
Sweet brown eyes and tresses , too ;
Cooing voice that murmurs oft ,

Are all in lovely bloom;
The balmy air is fragrant with
The flowers' sweet perfume.

The winds breathe softest music
Among the flowers and leaves;
The hallelujah chorus
Is wafted on the breeze;

For merry birds are singing
Through all the livelong day;
All nature thrills with gladness
This charming month of May.

The orchards and the meadows,
The brooks that ripple by,
The grasses and the flowers,
The lovely deep blue sky.

The little insects creeping,
All join with glad accord
In showing forth the beauty,
And praises of the Lord.

Shall human tongues be silent
While nature's voice doth sing?
Ah! no, let every mortal
A grateful anthem sing.

And shines fair liberty.

All praise to Thee who broke
The fetters and the rod
Of slavery's galling yoke. CHORUS

The men who fought and died,
The boys who wore the blue
Their country's love and pride. CHORUS

To stay the hand of fate.

A Remarkable Epitaph,(Anonymous),(Anonymous),"""God wills us free; man wills us slaves.
I will as God wills; God's will be done.
Here lies the body of John Jack,
A native of Africa who died March, 1773, aged about sixty years.
Though born in a land of slavery,
He was born free.
Though he lived in a land of liberty,
He lived a slave;
Till by his honest though stolen labour,
He acquired the source of slavery,
Which gave him his freedom;
Though not long before Death, the great tyrant,
Gave him his final emancipation,
And put him on a footing with kings.
Though a slave to vice,
He practised those virtues
Without which kings are but slaves.""

The fly was on the butter
And the butter on the fly:
If the butter had the wings on it
It couldn't help but fly.

They say the little wooly worm,
Or caterpillar spry—-
That creeps along the trees of shade,

Now, if he makes the butterfly
He ought to be a fly:

On batter cakes, in pies;

A Song of Living,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"It is so good to be alive;
To have deep dreams; to greatly strive
Through the day's work; to dance and sing
Between the times of sorrowing
To have a clear faith in the end
That death is life's best, trustful friend.

To be alive-to hear and see
This wonderful, strange pageantry
Of earth, in which each hour's session
Brings forth a new unknown procession
Of joys- stars, flowers, seas and grass,
In ever new guise before me pass.

To have deep dreams -ah me, ah me,
To bring far things close by to see;
To have my voyaging soul explore
Beyond my body's ponderous door.
To make my love from a thousand graces,
Seen in a thousand women's faces.

To greatly strive-perform my share
Of work-for the world grows more fair
To him who measures time and fate
By what his laboring days create
For work is the voice that lifts to God
The adoration of the sod.

To dance and sing-my body's praise
For being fair in many ways.
It hath no other voice than this
To thank God for a moment's bliss
When art and heaven together trust
Joy to the perfection of the dust.

Times of sorrowing yea, to weep
To wash my soul with tears, and keep
It clean from earth's too constant gain,
Even as a flower needs the rain
To cool the passion of the sun,
And takes a fresh new glory on.

To have clear faith:--through good and ill
We but perform some conscious will
Higher than man's. The world at best
In all things doth but manifest
That God has set his eternal seal
Upon the unsubstantial real.

Though your eyes have never burned me,
Nor your lips have spake, and turned me
   In a whirl of mad delight.
But the many stars that whisper
   In the night,
And the vagrant winds that lisper
   Through the day
In the music of my dreams have learned to play
   Malaguéna, Malaguéna--

All things name you, Malaguéna,
   Malaguena, Malaguéna
Birds that sing in rangeless rapture,
And the glory that we capture
   From the coronated rose:
All the passion in the ocean's
   Ebbs and flows;
Ah, they fill me with emotions
   Hot as flame
When I seek you in the shadow of a name,
   Malaguéna, Malaguéna!

When I meet you, Malaguéna,
   Malaguéna, Malaguéna
Shall we stop and gaze in wonder?
Nav, like winds that meet in thunder
   We will close in tight embrace,
And my kisses flash like lightning
   On your face;
Then our souls will feel the tightning
   Each to each,
Till remoulded into one they break in speech,

La Belle De Demerara,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Her face was a fair olive hue;
Eyes like a tropic night when dew
Makes the air heavy to the sea's rim;
Figure like a willow, subtle, slim,
That had the grace of a young queen;
Hair, as the Empress Josephine
Fashioned, when Paris bowed to her
--La Belle de Demerara.

I see it all as in a dream
Georgetown's seawall, where the stream
Of Quality flows; among them moves
She, whom the city's pride approves,
What beauty gave and virtue crowned
When music charmed their lips to sound
This name their hearts bestowed on her,
--La Belle de Demerara.

Sir Francis Hincks, at Government House
On a gala night before her bows;
Out from England on duty sent
The Colonel of the regiment
Glides with her in the stately dance;
And in her soft vivacious glance
Chief-Justice Beaumont bends to her 
--La Belle de Demerara.

O Poet who sang of Dorothy Q.,
I have a great-grandmother too;
Born in a British colonial place,
Sent to learn Parisian grace;
Who won all hearts in her demesne
By the far deep blue Carribbean
And large is the debt I owe to her,
--La Belle de Demerara.

Messengers of Dreams,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"My heart can tell them, every one,
The messengers of dreams that run
Above the tree -tops in the sun.

Whether of great or little worth
They carry the heart's desires forth
East and west and south and north.

I know the night will close them in—-
And they will meet the tempest's din—-
Ere they come to that far -off inn.

The inn that stands on the bourne ofhope,
Where Fear and Delight together cope
For victory on a little slope.

My heart can tell them, every one,
The returning messengers that run
Above the tree tops-in the sun.

Ephesus ,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"A mighty temple raised in the air,
   With piles of jewels, heaps of stone,
Ionic columns large and fair 
    And great Diana on her throne -- 
Such splendor did Demetrius
Bestow on ancient Ephesus.
And this was once the glorious scene 
    Of miles on miles of gilded things;
But now where once a famous queen
    Did reign, dull Silence sits and sings;
Of all the pomp that once was known 
Scarce lingers now one stone on stone. 
         Once here on this benighted spot
    Whose living live less than its dead,
A multitude did pray and plot, 
    Urged on by what a preacher said;
And men before God's throne did fall
When once they heard the words of Paul.
A heathen emperor's stern behest,
    Seven Christian brothers doomed to die,
Two hundred years in Coelian's breast,
    No thought of time that flitted by--
Such was the wonder of the spell
These youth awoke one day to tell.
A kingdom of the ancient world,
    The arms of Persia and of Rome,
Ten thousand souls to Hades hurled,
    And a world-conqueror's dream of home--
Such glory once the world did see;
But Alexander-- where is he?
And where is all the mighty host 
    That on Olympus sang and strove? 
Where are the gods those peaks did boast?
    Where now is Dian? Where is Jove?
All- all in Time's great bosom sleep;
Such secrets doth Oblivion keep. ",July,1907,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,Intertext,,Chicago,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sanctuary,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"I have drunk in the fullest measure 
    The draught of the Demon's flesh-wine,
And over the wrecks of my pleasure
    The lights of the lower world shine;
And now here to-night I am thinking 
     Of all the dark paths I have trod,
And I hate all the sin and the sinking 
    And want to go back to my God.
I am tired of the night and its yearnings, 
    I am tired of the pain in my breast;
I am weary of jealousy's burnings,
    And am longing for quiet and rest;
For the pain in my prison is pressing
Me down, and the Tempter is there---
I want to go back to the blessing
    And breath of a holier air.
O heart, you and I are but lovers ,
    And we love in the human way;
Even now in the darkness there hovers
    Around us the light of they day;
But we know just as sure as that gladness
    Is up in the heaven on high,
That our sinning is folly and madness
    And will bring its despair by and by 
So to-night while our warm hearts are beating
    And our blood surges up hot and bold,
While we once again are repeating 
    The story ten thousand years old,
May our hearts be uplifted, united,
    May the flesh see the fate it deserves,
May our love in its richness be lighted 
    By the best in ourselves that it serves.
I am weary of envy and sinning,
    I am weary of fever and strife, 
I turn myself now to the winning
    Of the best and the noblest in life;
What is better than love at its purest?
    What is worse than the love of the sod?
And the love that is firmest and surest 
    Is the love that is nearest God. ",October,1907,Voice of the Negro,"J.W.E. Bowen, J. Max Barber",,male,,,Chicago,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Griffith_Brawley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am swinging in the sky,
I am wringing worlds awry;
I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
I am the soul of the soul-toil kills,
Wraith of the ripple of trading rills;
Up I’m curling from the sod,
I am whirling home to God;
I am the Smoke King

I am wreathing broken hearts,
I am sheathing love’s light darts;

Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes—
Lurid lowering ’mid the blue,
Torrid towering toward the true,

I am black!
I am darkening with song,
I am hearkening to wrong!
I will be black as blackness can—
The blacker the mantle, the mightier the man!
For blackness was ancient ere whiteness began.
I am daubing God in night,
I am swabbing Hell in white:
I am the Smoke King
I am black.

I am the Smoke King
I am black!
I am cursing ruddy morn,
I am hearsing hearts unborn:
Souls unto me are as stars in a night,
I whiten my black men—I blacken my white!

Faithful, unswerving and true,
And when others have mocked and rejected me
Safe comfort I've found in you.

Oft through the day and oft in the night,
When trouble loomed darkly around,
I have fled to your arms and forever and aye
Unmeasured peace have I found.

If I journey by land or travel at sea,
No matter how long I sojourn, 
When I'm back at home you give me a seat,
And welcome with warmth my return.

The world offers this and the world offers that,
But nowhere such rest have I known
As that which I find when you bear me up,
And I sit like a king on his throne.

Vexatious inquiries you never make,
And you never my thoughts disturb,
And whenever I wish to fall asleep
My wishes you don't try to curb.

That nothing but death shall part me from you,

Beyond the Hill,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"Up the long hill atoiling,
From dawn till set of sun,
And O that I knew, my Master,
What waits me when toil is done.

Before me the hill,looms darkly,
My steps few joys attend,
Forgive me, O my Master,
But I would that I knew the end.

Am I to plod on through darkness
To darkness deeper yet?
Is there to be no morning
When my last sun is set?

Out of the dark comes the answer.
Faith speaks - O my soul, be still!
The light of eternal morning
Is shining beyond the hill!

The Diamond Ring,Powell W. Gibson,Gibson,"A dandy looking drummer
   While in a Southern town
Was accosted by a bootblack
   Of complexion dusky brown;
Whose crownless hat and patches
   Was a puzzle to behold,
And how they stayed upon him
   Is a mystery untold.

Said the bootblack, ""Have er shine, Boss?
   Only cost a haf a dime,
And your shoes will take your picture
   In about three minutes' time.""
Soon the bargain was completed
   And quite soon the work was done,
Then the drummer with the bootblack
   Thought to have a bit of fun.

Said he, ""Jake, I cannot pay you
   For my purse I've failed to bring.
How'd you like to take in payment
  This expensive diamond ring?""
Then with weird and comic gestures,
   With intense affected pride,
And with sparkling eyes triumphant
  Jake in cunning tones replied:

""Go' long, Boss, an' quit yer foolin,'
   Aain't gwi' do no sich a thing,
'Cause de police sho to 'rest me 
   Ef dev ketch me wid dat ring.
'Cause dey sho gwi' say I stoled it
   Jes to take somewhere to sell.

""No! no! Boss, jes keep dat diamond
   Fer hard luck some other time;
All I axes ub you, mistah,
   Gib ter me ma haf a dime.

The Twenty-Fifth Infantry,T. Grant Gilmore,Gilmore,"Come, boys! there's a call to arms. 
Our country needs our and 
Don't think of home and loved ones, 
Come, fall in the grade 

You know the fathers of this land 
Who died that she be free 
Are looking for us to uphold 
The flag of Liberty 

And so they did etch noble black 
Went forth to face the foe, 
Whose heart was light for country's cause 
While home was desolate with woe 

Loved ones praved to God above. 
To spite them with His might. 
That they return with honor 
To their home and land of right

And God did spare that noble band 
To return to home and friends. 
They are an honor to their race 
They stand like noble men. 

Back to regular duty, 
Stationed here and there, 
Though in the service of Uncle Sam 
Not welcomed anywhere. 

What means this feeling of hatred? 
Are we not one of this country’s sons?
Have we not done our duty, 
Each and every one? 

Well, we'll not complain, comrades, 
Our forefathers suffered before: 
We'll do our duty like soldiers 
As they did in days of yore.

But remember there's a bitter feeling
That is moving through the land
And no matter whatever happens
We will stand un man for me.

From Washington came the order
To the 25th Infantry renowned
You will move with the battalion
And  be stationed at Fort Brown

It was on the night of the 12th

While de tending then iives of Brownsville

[Illegible stanza]

The shooting, then became general, 
Each man's life was in his hands; 
On the [date] of August, at Brownsville, 
Came a sorrow o'er this land.

Then came the investigation 
Ordered by the Commander-in-Chief, 
To bring to a Southern bar for trial. 
To add more to their grief 

“Now tell who did the shooting 
And how it all begun;"" 
But not one word escaped their lips
That noble band stood mum. 

Well, if you will shield the guilty 
Your fame as soldiers is erased: 
You are discharged, every man of you, 
Dishonored and disgraced.

Ah but who can say dishonor .
In the land of toil and strife,
When men stand by their comrades
For the protection of their life.

In justice to their comrades,
In justice to their home,
We'll await that final tribunal
When God sits on His throne.

Let angels prostrate fall:

And crown Him Lord of all.""",January,1907,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,male,"Spanish-American War, Patriotism, Lynching and Racialized Violence",,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a crown that gleams in splendor

Fleeting as the breath of flowers

Some will win and some must fail.

Lulls the fainting soul to sleep,
And its lullaby entrancing
Through the love-lit valleys sweep.
Truly life's amighty ocean,
With its hurricanes and death,
While both weeping maids and mothers
Linger near with faltering breath.

Somewhere life had its beginning,
As the streams that glide along
In the sunshine of the morning,
Singing oft a happy song.
And this life will have its ending
As the sun at vesper goes,
When the veil of night is dropping
Noiseless to its long repose.

When,George Reginald Margetson,Margetson,"When shall my hand and heart be free
To try the far off heights of Fame,
On her fair page to write my name
And shine till Time shall cease to be?

When shall my soul take wings and mount
To that proud shrine where Glory stands,
And beckons me with willing hands,
To come and lave me at her fount?

I cannot gain the means to rise,
Denied am I the right to soar,
Because I'm black, because I'm poor
Would men their fellowman despise?

And yet There is my natural bent,
I have the gift in endles flow,
I have the will to make it glow,
But cruel Fate will not consent.

And so I move as doth a ball,
Upon the bosom of the tide,
Unable its own course to guide,
Obeys the ever -breaking squall.

But lest my years for naught be spent
In drifting aimless o'er the tide,
I'll wrest the rudder of my pride
And steer Life's barque to where 'tis bent.

Ecstasy,Azalia E. Martin,Martin,"The poet pens with busy brain
A joyous little song;
He reads it o'er and o'er again,
It cheers his soul along.
How often a wounded heart it heals,
To the sad and lone brings mirth,
But the ecstacy that the poet feels
Is greater than wealth of earth.

The sculptor sees in the rugged stone,
Beauties that few may see,
He chisels away with his thoughts alone
To set that beauty free.
Would the sculptor barter his soul's delight
When he views that finished mold,
For a king's vast wealth or a monarch's might
Or aught that the world might hold?

Soft music's strain may charm the ear
Of the listener all intent,
Then he seems to feel his heaven near
And his soul filled with content.
But he who sets that music free
Its ecstacy can tell,
Within his soul there joy can be
Where the Infinite may dwell.

Within some household, lone and still,
Some humble one may move,
Who quietly doeth the Master's will
And every wrong reprove.
The skilled musician, poet, all,
May know of higher life;
But ecstacy rules in this hall,
This home that knows not strife.

The Day of Life,Charles L. Mayberry,Mayberry,"I stood 'neath the boughs of the slender oaks
At the dawn of a fair spring day,
As the golden king his rays dispatched
O'er the landscape far away.

I watched the radiant, sparkling beams
As they tripped through the dew-kissed trees,
While the birds in one melodious strain
Kept time to the rippling breeze.

Each outstretched field and stately hill
Was adorned in gorgeous green,
And the air was filled with fragrance rare
From the flowers that blushed unseen.

The shamrock peeped from its tiny cell
To salute the new -born day,
And the swift -winged bee stole a gentle sip
From the wild flowers by the way.

The gray squirrel whisked through the forest boughs
With a heart that was light and gay,
While the snow -fleeced lambs on the green hillsides
Took turns in their childlike play.

The sparkling stream with its merry din
Ran nimbly over its bed,
And the wild spring flowers waved a parting kiss,
Then blushed to a crimson red.

I stood with rapt'rous wonder stunned,
And thought of the Powerful Hand
That had brought into being this marvelous host
To enliven the beauteous land.

I came again at the eventide;
The sun was sinking low;
His fading beams like a fleeting life
Had lost all their noonday glow.

Each field and hill lay brown and bare,
Which once had been decked in green;
The trees of their foliage had been bereft—
Not a floweret gay could be seen.

No music rang through the forest boughs,
No sweet melodious chime;
The songsters, pierced by the chilling blast,
Had flown to a fairer clime.

Through tears I scanned the once strong oaks
That had stood for many ayear,
And I thought them a glimpse of our human life
When the close of our days is near.

But, ah! at the close of our day of life,
We from the grave shall ascend;
For the Powerful Hand that gave us birth 
Will be with us still in the end.

I Know A Paradise Apart,Henry Davis Middleton,Middleton,"Princess of fortune, fads and chance,
   Beau Brummels of the present day,  
Sir Knights who don the sword and lance,
   And bravely join the martial fray,
Ye swear by all your gods, they say,
   Your castles have no counterpart:
Harken to this refrain I pray 
   I know a paradise apart!

Ye cads who prate with nonchalance
   And ribald raptures oft display,
Dashing devotees of the dance
   In which you madly whirl and sway,
Your pleasures are of yesterday,
   Mere relics of a waning art.
For pleasures that defy dismay
   I know a paradise apart.

Daughters whom beauty doth enhance,
   Nimrods seeking their nimble prey,
Heroines of some sad romance,

Each wanders in his wonted way,
   In blind pursuit of pleasure's mart,
To Eden's doomed decay

Unrequited Love,Jasper Tappan Phillips,Phillips,"As twilight marked the closing day
   And all was still,
I looked upon the fading scene
   And felt the thrill
Of birds that sang their vesper hymns
  In doleful strain;
And then the thoughts of my lost love
   Filled me with pain.
I thought of how we used to love
   In days of yore,
Before she sighed and told me that
   Our love was o'er;
I long to see her smiling face
   And hear her voice
That always bade me not to weep,
   But rather to rejoice.

The man that claims her as a bride,
   Has left me bare
He can but love and idolize
   A gem so rare,
But as I think of my sad fate 
   I wish me dead,
Because I gave my heart's best love
   To the girl he wed.

Rural Night Scenes ,Olivia Seivis,Seivis,"Twas in the gloaming , deep in forest shade
When shadows darken, and the ghost, unlaid,
Wrapping himself about in garments white
Prepares to stalk away into the night.
Above, the jewelled canopy stretched out
Piercing the sable gloom of Erebus;
And darkness summoning her couriers fleet
Each hastily despatched on errands meet.

The herdsman in his cheerful cot hard-by
Offered a sample prayer to Him on high.
His fare was poor---a dish of pulse, some bread,---
Yet he was happier than if better fed.
Each day his hands their humble task essayed;
At even-tide he felt himself well-paid.

The rich man in his palace on the hill
His larder filled with trophies of the kill;
His cellars overflowed with rich old wine,---
Old Rhenish, which was mellowed much by time.
No prayer, no word of thanks , came from his mouth;
Even to bow his head the man was loath.

The hermit sat before his cheerless board
Scanning with glut'nous eyes his glittering hoard.
To him it was a feast, a feast indeed;
For other food than this he felt no need.
And thus the miser sat through half the night,
Basking in his treasure's reflected light .

Down in the vale in still sequestered nook
A farmhouse nestled near the purling brook;
And through the half dim light a pace before
Behold the genial farmer in the door!
Within the busy house-wife bustled 'round
Spreading the homely board with viands sound,
With herbs, maize bread and other wholesome messes,
Which soon the jovial good -man warmly blesses.

'Tis night:
Two youthful lovers thread the mountain path,
Waking the slumb'ring Echo with each laugh.
Some ancient jest the jocund swain essayed,---
With trilling laughter then replied the maid:
"" Kind sir , when first mine ears thou didst assail,
With ever ready wit and pleasing tale,
Methought that ne'er before was swain so bright,
Who could with minstrel speech surpass the knight.
But now, most valiant sir, I must confess
That common usage under-rates the best---""
""And like enow 'tis true,' observed the lad,
'Abuses make the very best, seem bad.""

'Tis late :
The Great Bear in the sky begins to fade,
My Reverie is broken---the Muse is fled.
A roseate hue the misty East o'erspreads
Pronouncing blessings on each sleepiug head.
The Dreamer rose, the tolling bell said one,
Aurora, Herald of the Dawn, had come.",October,1907,Colored American Magazine,Fred R. Moore,,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Query,Daniel B. Thompson,Thompson,"I love to sit in a shady park,
When evening's sun is sinking low,
Amid the landscape's ruddy glow,
And hear my spaniel's honest bark.

Brave, patient, faithful, gentle friend,
With pendent ears and snowy breast,
The shrine of feelings unexpressed,
My heart to you I would commend.

I look into your lustrous eyes,
As soft and clear as some limpid stream,
And wonder, can the inward gleam
Bespeak a soul that never dies?

The agony of feelings mute,
Of thoughts too deep for human tongue,
That mock all effort to be sung
Is this, too, shared by the stolid brute?

No stunted growths in Nature's schemes?
No cruel tyranny of Fate,
That fiction base of ancient date,
To cheat us of our golden dreams?

And he, ""the brute of slight remove,""
Now sweetly called the Nation's ""child,""
May he, too, hold a vision wild
A humble chance his worth to prove?

Why toss him, then, as a worthless toy?
His manhood rights from him why steal?
Why take from him fair Freedom's seal?
Why crush the soul of a Negro boy?

Autumn,Daniel B. Thompson,Thompson,"    There is a joy
A feeling sweet without alloy,
    That fills the soul
When Autumn skies their beauties roll
    Before the eyes.
With splendors rich in sweet surprise;
    When plants and flow`rs,
Which Summer sun and gentle show'rs
    Had clothed in green,
In brighter garments may be seen,
    In tints and hues,
Which glisten in the morning dews.

    The verdant vine,
Whose tangled tresses neatly line
    The ugly gap
That storm has made in Nature's lap.
    Resplendent shows.
When Autumn's breath upon it blows.
    The shady seat,
Where Comfort sought relief from heat
    In noonday hour,
When Phoebus beamed in greatest pow'r,
    Now sweetly woos
By beauties rich which Autumn strews.
    
	No dark'ning cloud,
With lightning forked and thunder loud,
    Now brings its fright,
As o'er the sky it rolls in might.
    No drenching rain,
In ruthless torrents poured amain,
    Claims as its spoil
The tardy fruits of farmer's toil.
    When Summer sped,
These dread attendants also fled,
    In deep alarm
At golden Autumn's peaceful charm.

    As Autumn sun
In less'ning circles makes its run,
    The ev'ning shade,
Of ever length'ning shadows made,
    Brings sweet increase
To hours when Nature sleeps in peace.
    O'er field and hill,
Whose products feed the busy mill,
    The silent Night,
With chilling touches soft and light,
    Distils her dews,
Whose teeming show'r the turf renews.

    In grove and field,
The Summer labors find their yield
    In grain and fruits,
And healthful herbs and tuber roots.
    The grateful swain,
As slowly creaks the brimming wain
    With Nature's store,
Deplores his toilsome lot no more;
    But Autumn's boon
He garners yet, till Harvest Moon,
    With mellow light,
A soft effulgence pours o'er Night.
   
   His labors done,
The farmer takes his dog and gun,
    To bring dismay
To timid hare and squirr'l at play.
    The cautious quail
He now pursues o'er grassy trail
    To bushy close,
Where covey feeds in deep repose.
     With fluttered whir,
A dozen wings the air bestir,
    And tempt the shot
That drops its victims to the spot.

    With quickened pace,
The farmer hies him from the chase
    When daylight fades,
And ev'ning, settling o'er the glades,
    Shields from his aim
The feathered tributes it would claim.
    With pouch well filled,
And aching limbs, fatigued and chilled.
    He greets the spot
Where dimly stands his little cot,
    Before whose fire
He sweetly rests the night entire.

    What sweeter joy,
When Autumn dullness tends to cloy,
    To find relief
In sports that bring not Nature grief:
    To range the hills
For treasures rich that Autumn spills.
    Yet bring no harm
To timid forms that take alarm:
    To show as spoil,
When ev'ning ends the thrilling toil,
    No lives annoyed.
Nor yet in wantonness destroyed.

A Prayer,Ralph W. Tyler,Tyler,"O Father, God of the universe wide!
Humbly, lo these many years , have we prayed
To Thee that hand of injustice be stayed,
And, that a Christ-led world ever abide
In peace, doing right unto men of dark
Skin as to proud Lucifer, who reckons
That the Star of Hope beams for, nor beckons
None save whose face doth bear Noah's mark.

Shall we, Lord, continue to suffer hate
The many wrongs that manhood debase, damn
Lives of them Thou divinely did create,
With skin a darker hue, for son of Ham,
Than Lucifer, or, remembering gyves,
Cease to ornate with patience humble lives?

In ten million breasts is nursed the hope,
Flickering like candle-light though it be,
Through divine dispensation we may grope
From out our segregated sphere and see,
Beyond years of transgression , some token
Of the promised mercy Thou hath spoken.

Merciful God, we know not now Thy will,
But as in the past, so in days to come;
Throughout all the long waiting years, until
Reason be dethroned complete, will we hum

I ask not that the future bring
The things whose praises worldlings sing:
Nor wealth, nor name, nor power e'en

The Black Sampson,Josephine Heard,Heard,"There's a Sampson lying, sleeping in the land, 
He shall soon awake, and with avenging hand, 
In an all unlocked for hour, 
He will rise in mighty power; 
What dastard can his righteous rage withstand? 

E'er since the chains were riven at a stroke, 
E'er since the dawn of Freedom's morning broke, 
He has groaned, but scarcely uttered, 
While his patient tongue ne'r muttered, 
Though in agony he bore the galling yoke. 

O, what cruelty and torture has he felt? 
Could his tears, the heart of his oppressor melt? 
In his gore they bathed their hands, 
Organized and lawless bands-— 
And the innocent was left in blood to welt.
 
The mighty God of Nations doth not sleep, 
His piercing eye its faithful watch doth keep, 
And well nigh His mercy's spent, 
To the ungodly lent: 
""They have sowed the wind, the whirlwind they shall reap."" 

From His nostrils issues now the angry smoke, 
And asunder bursts the all-oppressive yoke; 
When the prejudicial heel 
Shall be lifted, we shall feel, 
That the hellish spell surrounding us is broke. 

The mills are grinding slowly, slowly on, 
And till the very chaff itself is gone; 
Our cries for justice louder, 
'Till oppression's ground to powder — 
God speed the day of retribution on! 

Fair Columbia's filmy garments all are stained; 
In her courts is blinded justice rudely chained; 
The black Sampson is awaking, 
And his fetters fiercely breaking; 
By his mighty arm his rights shall be obtained.

The Ideal,I. Dwight Fairfield,Fairfield,"When I hear a youth expand,
""I have such an ideal friend,""
I think, while I silent keep,
Just another dreamer sleep.

Sore has disappointed me,""

Men are friendly-friends are rare,""

For I know that youth is wise.

The Untold,Gertrude H. Dorsey Brown,Brown,"There are heroes in the great beyond
Whose names no history tells;
There are many in the vast unknown
Whose praise no charms swells.

There are fathers who have fought alone,
Alone in rain or sun,
But by their toils, which few will own,
Great, victories have been won.

The mothers who have suffered much
That others might be blest,
Yea, legion is the name of such,
Whose deeds are unconfessed.

The mountain cave may be the spot,
The valley hut the place
Where, in the peasant's lodge or cot
Is hid a hero's face.

Beauty has lived whose perfect grace
A Raphael's virgin vied;
No artist drew the lovely face,
His colors lie untried.

Birds and flowers have passed away
Whose matins and whose bloom
No human ear has caught the lay,
No mortal the perfume.

Some one deserved the laurel wreath
Another's brow adorns,
But lo, he fainted in the heath,
Beneath a crown of thorns.

Some one, some where, in times of need
Has righted divers wrongs
No poet words his noble deed,
No minstrel sings his songs.

The songs unsung, and deeds untold,
The beauty still unfound;
The lambs who never knew a fold
The heroes left uncrowned.

They number more than tongue can tell
As each age adds its store,
While years and months the army swell,
And still there's more and more. 

'Tis not the brush, nor verse, nor song,
Nor homage of the clan
That helps humanity along—
The ACTION makes the man.

However secret be the place
Of duties performed well,
God's book of records none erase
Eternity will tell.

Retrospection,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"When you and I were young, the days
Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
And full of joy from dawn till close,
From morning's mist till evening's haze.
And when the robin sung his song
The verdant woodland ways along,
We whistled louder than he sung.
And school was joy, and work was sport
For which the hours were all too short,
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, the woods
Brimmed bravely o'er with every joy
To charm the happy-hearted boy.
The quail turned out her timid broods;
The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
Held high black cups of harmless wine;
And low the laden grape-vine swung
With beads of night-kissed amethyst
Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, the cool
And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
Save where we 'd worn an ent'ring place.
How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
How flashed the spray as we plunged in,—
Pure gems that never caused a sin!
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, we heard
All sounds of Nature with delight,—
The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
The chirping of the baby-bird.
The columbine's red bells were rung;
The locust's vested chorus sung;
While every wind his zithern strung
To high and holy-sounding keys,
And played sonatas in the trees—
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, we knew
To shout and laugh, to work and play,
And night was partner to the day
In all our joys. So swift time flew
On silent wings that, ere we wist,
The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
And from our hearts this cry was wrung—
To fill with fond regret and tears
The days of our remaining years—
""When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.""

If,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"If life were but a dream, my Love,

A barren, barren world were this
      Without one saving gleam;
I 'd only ask that with a kiss

No more the air is sharp and cold;
The planter wends across the wold,
And, glad, beneath the shining sky .

This song of Spring, Spring!

Disappointed,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar," An old man planted and dug and tended,
    Toiling in joy from dew to dew;
  The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;
    Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
  Then he said: ""I will quiet my thrifty fears,
  For here is fruit for my failing years.""

  But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
    Swallowing up the azure sky;
  The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
    The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
  Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
  Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.

  The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
    Viewing the place the storm had swept;
  And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
    He bowed him down to the earth and wept.
  But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;
  ""Arise, old man, and plant again!""",June,1908,Colored American,Fred R. Moore,,male,,Lyrics of Lowly Life,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By The Stream,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass,
  How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass,
  And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads,
  Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads.
  And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go,
  For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show,
  And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries,
  When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.",June,1908,Colored American ,Fred R. Moore,,male,,Lyrics of Lowly Life,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frederick Douglass,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"A hush is over all the teeming lists,
And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife;
A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists
And vapors that obscure the sun of life.
And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,
Laments the passing of her noblest born.

She weeps for him a mother's burning tears--
She loved him with a mother's deepest love
He was her champion thro' direful years,
And held her weal all other ends above.
When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,
He raised her up and whispered, ""Hope and Trust.""

For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung
That broke in warning on the ears of men;
For her the strong bow of his pow'r he strung
And sent his arrows to the very den
Where grim Oppression held his bloody place
And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.

And he was no soft-tongued apologist;
He spoke straight-forward, fearlessly uncowed;
The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist
And set in bold relief each dark-hued cloud;
To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,
And hurled at evil what was evil's due.

Thro' good and ill report he cleaved his way
Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,
Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array--
The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.
He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,
And answered thunder with his thunder back.

When men maligned him and their torrent wrath
In furious imprecations o'er him broke,
He kept his counsel as he kept his path;
'Twas for his race, not for himself, he spoke.
He knew the import of his Master's call
And felt himself too mighty to be small.

No miser in the good he held was he--
His kindness followed his horizon's rim.
His heart, his talents and his hands were free
To all who truly needed aught of him.
Where poverty and ignorance were rife,
He gave his bounty as he gave his life.

The place and cause that first aroused his might
Still proved its pow'r until his latest day.
In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right
Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;
Wrong lived; His occupation was not gone.
He died in action with his armor on!

We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,
And felt the magic of his presence nigh,
The current that he sent thro'out the land,
The kindling spirit of his battle-cry
O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet
And place our banner where his hopes were set!

Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,
But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!
Thou'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar
And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.
She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,
She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,
And rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,
She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!",February,1908,Colored American,Fred R. Moore,"Sestain, Elegy",male,Frederick Douglass,Majors and Minors,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Content With My Own Calling,Peter E. Browne,Browne,"If I were a bird, a sweet song -bird
Which, far away, some tale had heard
Of aching hearts and lives grown sad,
Of souls which comfort never had,
I'd come and haunt their dismal way
And gaily sing my sweetest lay,
To draw their cheerless hearts away
   From sorrow and from sighing.

If I were a stream, a lovely stream,
Winding amid some perfect dream
Of woodland beauty,and had learned
How travelers thirst and poets yearned,
I'd call the thirsty ones to drink;
Bid poet, while I sing, to think
And hope I'd draw them from the brink
   Of blank discouragement.

If I were a star, a distant star,
Shining in beauty from afar
O'er desert waste,on tangled wood
Where some poor soul in darkness stood,
I'd concentrate my rays of light
Upon his path of deepest night
To light him in his way aright
   From groping, stumbling, falling.

If I were an angel, angel fair,
Speeding God's message (far and near
O'er land and sea where'er man dwell)
Of love and life through Christ, I'd tell
That message in my sweetest tone;
Would teach -- plead that men might own
Their sin, repent, and at God's throne
   Redemption seek from dying.

But now that I am amortal man,
Created by God's holy hand
Like angel, star, like bird, like stream,
Which each doth do its task and seem
Content - since God in Providence
Hath made me this, Omnipotence
Rules all supreme,and Iam still,
   Silenced by His own holy will:

For I must be more fit by far
To be a man than stream or star,
Than bird or angel,more or less;
I'll cheer and charm and light and bless,
I'll fructify just as I am,
Make use the powers God gave to man,
And do e'en more than angels can,
Content with my own calling.

In Days of Yore,George B. Thornton,Thornton,"On a bright, fantastic day,
In the flow'ry month of May,
Whilst upon a bow'ry fair,
Strolling in the morning air,
Pan, of vanished days of yore,
Meeting Echo, greetings bore
Greetings fond and full of feeling,
Modest, friendly, warm, appealing.
Twas in a grove, apart, alone,
In the shine of Helicon;
Dapple green was nature's dress,
And, amidst her loveliness,
Bees around the blossoms winging
And the feath'ry family singing,
Fountains flowing, full and free,
Told a tale of ecstasy.

""Hail, thou nymph of fair delight;
Hail, deceiver of my sight,
Have I met thee fast a-Maying,
Full into my vision straying,
Dressed in robes of pearly white,
Garments dazzling to my sight?.
Thou are ever still caressing
Hills and vales, and dropping blessings,
Murmuring voices of the air,
Making merry everywhere!
Come, and tell it as we go
Why thou hast been timid so,
Hiding 'mong the flow'rs and hills,
Meads and valleys, rocks and rills,
Whilst I, dwelling all alone,
Roam the shine of Helicon!
Thou art all in all to me,
Sweet, thou nymph, Euphrosyne,
And 'twill be a kind of pleasure
To assist me in my leisure!
We can live up in the trees,
Round the blossoms, like the bees,
And our gladness will be long,
Smacking doubly full of song.
Tell me thou wilt live with me
During this eternity,
In the pleasantness of hours
In the middle of the bow'rs,
Such as elsewhere there are none
As are those of Helicon!
May thou concord freely give,
And with me forever live.""

""I am Echo, nymph of air,
Habitating everywhere,
Ever wonted to be sad,
Wishing ever to be glad,
And I hide among the hills,
Meads and valleys, rocks and rills,

Roam the shine of Helicon.
It will be a kind of pleasure
To assist thee in thy leisure;
We can live up in the trees,
Round the blossoms, like the bees,
And our gladness will be long,
Smacking doubly full of song.
I will ever live with thee,
During this eternity!
In the night-time of the hours,
These will be our nuptial bow'rs,
Nymphs and Naiads will be there,
And the fairy troops of air;
They will all come out to see
How we make solemnity,
Phantoms following, tripping sweet,
Sylphs and seraphs wil they meet,
Fays and elves will join the ring,
And assist the balancing,
While we make an antic round,
Treading nimbly on the ground;
Then to sphery realms so soon,
Some will soar up to the moon,
Others, dwelling here below,
To the nether worlds will go.

""Now I conjure me up the hour
Through the aid of Hecate's power,
And our nuptials swift beginning,
Hand in hand we go a- spinning,
Marking out an antic round,
Treading nimbly on the ground,

And the fairy troops of air.
Now I raise my hand on high,
Pointing upward to the sky;
Sprites and phantoms, take your flight
Through the middle of the night,
Soaring smoothly, some so soon
Sit upon the corner'd moon,
Others, dwelling here below,
To the nether regions go.

You,Lady Emma Louise Phillips,Phillips,"Yesterday the world was beautiful and gay,
Roses and violets were blooming by the way,
The tiny blue bells drank the dew,
The birds sang sweetly in the leafy boughs,
All nature was clad in bright array,
   I walked with you.

To-day the world is dark and drear;
No roses and violets to greet me by the way.
The tiny bluebells are asleep,
The little birds have ceased to sing;
My heart is sad and lonely,
   I walk alone.

June,Effie D. Threet,Threet,"Nature blushes 'neath the gaze

Filling all the earth around

Sunbeams kiss the lovely face

A Forest Hymn,R. L. Simpson,Simpson,"What means that cadence, soft and low,
That rises, falls, in rhythmic flow?
        Hark!
   From the distant plain
   It sounds again.
         Hark!
   From yonder mountain peak
   Sweet voices seem to speak,
   As tho ' descending, chamois -like,
   From rock to rock. What awe they strike!
         Hark!

From hill and vale toward yonder wood,
Where oak and ash and all have stood
For years and years, defying time,
They all converging seem to chime.
         Hark!
   Those voices, dying ne'er,
   Sounding on the morning air,
   Seem greater life and strength to gain
   With every beat and measure of refrain.
         Hark!

Blending, chiming, with sweetest harmony,
That sounds like to angelic minstrelsy.
   They slowly near.
From forest and valley that strange chorus sounds
Like the sweet, fettered voices of angels unbound,
   Till at last it is here.
      List!
   Bird and beast and all are still;
   Winding there about the hill,
   E'en the stream that flows along
   Stops to listen to the song.
      Still!
   How those voices blend and chime!
   (Sweeter far than yours and mine.)
   Now 'tis slow, now 'tis fast;
   Now 'tis here; now 'tis past;
   Then back again, and soft recede,
   And almost in the distance dies away;
   Then, loud and louder, as tho' freed
   From all restraints; but ever, ever gay.
      Hark!!!

No poet's pen, no genius ' ready tongue
      Can ever limn
The beauty, grandeur, splendent glory
      Of that simple forest hymn.

Dreams of Life (excerpt),T. Thomas Fortune,Fortune,"There were no kings of men till men
Made kings of men, and of the earth;
There were no privileged classes when
First Nature, man and beasts, had birth.

Man was sole monarch of his sphere,
And each with equal power was made;
Each from the earth partook his share;
Each shared with each earth's sun and shade.

No fetters on the limbs were bound;
The intellect was free as light;
Man's every wish abundance found;
He gloried in his earth-wide right.

Of mountain and of smiling vale—

Not By Bread Alone,Silas X. Floyd,Floyd,"Alas, in those times, 'tis true in all climes, in spite of the lark that sings,
Man goeth apace in a mad wild race, and lays down his life for Things!
If we search far and wide, on every side, the end kept in view is the same:
Man counts for naught where the battles are fought, and Things in the end of the game.

For butter and bread, with hurrying tread, man goeth forth to the fray:
And when more and more his larder runs o'er, he thinks he has won the day.
Man bold that their strength throughout the world's length is houses and money and landa s for their souls,
And so for their souls, from equator to poles, they lift not the weight of their hands.

Keepers of the Temple,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Earth -- out of Earth God shaped and made
All lovely things to signify His love:-
The flowers arrayed
On the shy amorous bosom of the Spring;
All vegetable forms that move
Up to the rain and sun for harvesting:
Odors and colors, beasts and birds
Are symbols, signs and words
Of the unfathomable mystery of Earth;
And out of Earth God made His spouse
Nature-the fruitful bride of His terrene house,
And her He filled with tears and mirth,
With grace and strength, and scorn and hate,
With hope and quietude,
Patience and fortitude,
Passion and dream,
And Fate:
Nature, the immaculate Mother, Nature the bride
Of God's own [illegible], conceived and brought
Forth of God's Spirit and Earth
Man to his birth.

The body of Man!
Infinite perfection of dust!
Shadowy as desire
On the crust
Of a world
In the blazing path of a million whirling suns;
Strong to lift all heaven's weight of stars
In the will of brain, and the fire
Of passionate, pulsing blood;
Swift as a lightning, hurled
Down by the sickle of Time;
Imperishable as bronze
In the seed of parenthood;
Beautiful and sublime
In color and shape and line:—
Divine,
This infinite perfection of dust,
The body of Man!

On this mysterious plan
God build Him His temple of Man 
Of indestructible dust;
And He gave ye the trust
As a sacred dower
To keep it in beauty
For ye are the priests and the keepers of this,
The visible temple of God.
From the time of man's birth to his sleep in the sod
Ye must hold to the duty,
The service and the sacrifice,
Building, rebuilding, and building anew
The structure of flesh, with the subtle device
Of a skill the schools have taught you,
Of a wisdom which Nature alone imparts.
Ye bring no wares to the marts,
Ye barter no loss or gain;
Ye stand at the altar-steps of life
For the sole redemption of pain.
Time and the world's unintelligible strife
Batter humanity
Patient and serene, ye come to lives that grieve.
Discern your dedicated duty
Heal and retrieve.

Ye gatherers here,—
Keepers with all the world's keepers
Of God's temple of dustYe tarry the dream from the sleepers,
And the death, life gives to your trust;--
And ye fare,
With your infinite skill, the perfect skill that ye have
When life battles with death,
Ye fare and lead us
Out of the hurts that bleed us,
Not alone from the grave
Of endless sleep:
But by the power ye have
When life struggles with death,
Ye keep
The pride and hope of a Race that toils the sleep.

Traveling in a world of gloom,
And behind the cradle stands
That rocket them, in oppression's tomb.

Nothing to guide; no path or mark,
Yet the race is marching fast,
Like brave pilgrims in the dark,
Forgetting trials of the past.

For struggling in a fertile wrath,
The way is often disagreeable,
But they keep the upward path.
Thorny is the road they travel

To reach the stars that shine above.

On what is not theire own;

But they soon will not be guided
By those who ring destruction's bell.

A Plea to the Muse,Aaron Belford Thompson,Thompson,"Oh Goddess of song, come grant a reflection! 
 Unbolt the great doors of memory's wall, 
 And there let me enter, in gardens, through   court-yards; 
 And view the great paintings, that hang   in the hall. 
 Then grant at yourieisure, some musical  measure; 
 My harp is untuned and infer' or to thine: 
 So pledge me one measure, 'twill be of great  pleasure. 
 Perchance it might soothe this vain yearn ing of mine. 
 
 Then away let me ramble, 'cross brooklets through brambles, 
 'Cross moorland through fallows, 
 
 To the far distant hill ; 
 Where the century eagle 'mong the cliffs find her hiding, 
 
 And the night winds bring notes, 
 From the wild whip-poor-will. 
 She took up her harp, embossed with rare jewels; 
 The numberless strings all glittered like gold; 
 Then a bright glittering ra in-bow decended from heaven, 
 Surounded the damsel, illuming the whole. 
  
 Her jewel decked fingers were active and nimble 
 A bracelet of rubies hung loose from her wrist, 
 Her dark curly locks had gold in their tresses; 
 Her face was so comely, there was nothing amiss. 
 She scarce touched the strings. 
 Ere the great harp responded; 
 
 The music was soft yet it echoed afar: 
 And the sweet chimes came back from wood-land and mountain. 
 And through the great halUway, whose door stood ajar. 
  I entered the hall-way and gazed at the paintings. 
 Both modern and ancient, magnificent,  grand ; 
 My eyes caught the beauty, 
 Mine ears drank the music; 
 That came from her harp, and re-echoed the land. 
 And last, but not least, to the rear of the hall-way. 
 There hung a great painting of wonderfulcost; 
 And the muse on her harp played a dirge sweet and solemn. 
 As I gazed at my crucified Lord on the cross. 
  His visage though care worn, 
 Sliowed love and compassion; 
 Great nails pierced His hands, 
 And like wise, His feet: 
 Me thought I could hear the wail of the women 
 Decending the vale of Mt. Calvary's Steep. 
 Then the muse touched the strings, 
 And a great song of triumph, 
 Rang out in the hall-way, 
 
 Ere I thought to depart, 
 While mine eyes caught the sight of a wonderful painting; 
  That brought great rapture and joy to my heart. 
  'Twas where He had entered. 
  The geat gates of Heaven, 
 And countless the angels about Him did throng;  
 Here the muse ceased her playing, 
  For she teared to attempt it, 
 And she blushed when I asked her, 
 To join in the song. 
 As I left the great hall-way, 
 The door closed behind me; 
 The muse she had vanished, 
 The music had ceased; 

 I awoke 'twas a dream- the rain was fast falling, 
 And the wind shook my lattice. 
 That came from the east.

The Warmspring Indian Legend of the Fox and the Spirits,Lucien M. Lewis,Lewis,"In a cave deep in the forest,
Where the pines and hemlocks whisper,
Dwelt the crafty fox, Lute-si-ah,
And his lovely little daughter.
Years before the mother left him,
Left him sad and broken-hearted ;
With a farewell benediction,
Left him clinging to his offspring.
Just as Summer passed to Autumn,
When the leaves were tinged with yellow ;
When the ice in flowery crystals,
Formed on all the pools and shallows,
Came a sickness on the children,
Bringing death and desolation.
And Lute-si-ah's little daughter
Paled and sickened with the others;
Drooped her head and gently withered,
Like a rosebud in the Autumn.
Loud Lute-si-ah cried in anguish,
Cried until through all the forest,
Rang his bitter lamentation,
Like the soughing of the pine trees.
“Oh, my daughter | "" cried he, wildly,
“You have left me without warning,
Left me old and broken-hearted :
I will follow till I find you,
I will cross the magic river ;
I will seek the land of spirits,
Till I find and recognize you.”
Straightway then the fox departed
On his strange and awful journey,
Day and night he traveled onward,
Ever eastward still he traveled,
Till he came unto the heavens,
To the regions of the spirits,
To the magic river, Wun-ner.
Blue its waters were and turbid,
Swift and cruel swept its current,
Singing, as it rolled and thundered,
Notes of sadness and of warning.
No one yet e'er crossed that river,
Unless spirit forms had rowed them,
Spirit forms must lead and guide them
To the land of dreams and visions,
To their home of bliss eternal.
And the lark, the merry Whool-hool,
In her bosom held the secret
How to signal for the spirits,
How to lure them and entice them
From repose in realms celestial.
Loud and long Lute-si-ah pleaded
With the Whool-hool for her secret ;
Told her of his age and weakness,
Of his pain and bitter sorrow ;
How his eyes were weak with weeping,
How his heart was almost broken,
Longing, seeking for his daughter.
Vain was all Lute-si-ah's pleading,
Fruitless was his inquisition,
For the Whool-hool sang unheedi
Sang derisively unceasing.
Flamed Lute-si-ah's heart within him,
Flamed with anger and with cunning,
Smouldered like an unseen ember,
Till the east wind blew and fanned it
Silently he stalked the Whool-hool,
With a spring he seized and crushed her,
Broke her legs and left her lying
Helpless, bleeding by the river.
{{Now,” he cried, his anger cooling,
“I will dictate while you listen
You no longer can torment me,
You no longer can refuse me.
I will make you legs of alder,
Make them better far and longer ; .
Make them durable and firmer :
You must first reveal your secret
How to signal for the spirits,
How to lure them and entice them
From repose in realms celestial.”
Then the Whool-hool told her secret,
In exchange for legs of alder ;
Told Lute-si-ah, in the marshes,
He must find a wand of willow,
Then lie down beside the river,
Wave his wand and whisper softly
For the spirits to receive him.
When Lute-si-ah gave his signal,
Lay down close beside the river,
Waved his wand and whispered softly,
Thought intently of his daughter;
In a twinkling changed the landscape,
Like a shifting panorama.
There was neither sun nor moonlight,
There was neither dawn nor twilight ;
But a silvery sheen of splendor,
From an unseen source shone on him.
Calm and tranquil was the river,
As a sheeted lake in winter;
All the air was filled with music,
Filled with music and with fragrance.
While Lute-si-ah gazed enchanted
At this wondrous transformation,
From the shore across the river,
Came a boat of gold, all burnished
Like the setting sun in Autumn.
Spirit forms manned oar and paddle,
That were made of shining silver,
Set with jewels rare and costly.
Noiselessly the boat sped onward,
Glided straight across the river
Paused and waited for a moment,
Like a spectre in the water.
Without sound or salutation,
To Lute-si-ah, spirits beckoned,
Took him in the boat beside them,
Rowed him back across the river
To the land of dreams and visions,
To the region of the spirits.
There he found his little daughter,
Found and recognized her spirit,
Heard her voice and saw her image,
Listened to her childish prattle.
In the spirit world around him,
There were Indians from all nations ;
Spirits that had long departed,
Came and talked to him in whispers ;
Listened to his tale of sorrow,
Comforted and reassured him,
Sympathized, and thus consoled him.
“We are happy,” said the spirits,
“We are happy and contented,
But for good of all the red men,
That the tribes may live and prosper,
Be a strong and vigorous nation,
We will go back earthward with you :
All the dead in all the ages,
Will assemble there together,
Till so numerous will our race be,
That the earth will scarcely hold us.”
On Lute-si-ah's back were fastened
Magic parcels wrapped in deer skin;
He was rowed across the river,
And with careful admonition,
There was given his instructions.
“You will find,” the spirits told him,
“When you reach the land of living,
Five steep mountains and deep valleys,
That will try your strength and courage.
Keep your eye upon the summit,
Pause not on your homeward journey,
Look not at the parcels on you,
Till the fifth hill you've ascended,
Lest the magic spell be broken.
Look not backward, look not sidewise ;
Listen not to friend or stranger,
Who may tempt you with their questions,
With their vain and idle gossip.”
Steep and rocky were the mountains,
Long and tiresome were the valleys,
That the fox found on his journey,
As he plodded slowly homeward.
Eagerly he crossed the first hill,
Then the second and the third one ;
Crossed the fourth, although his burden
Sorely tempted and oppressed him.
On the final hill, the fifth one,
As Lute-si-ah labored upward,
Tisch, the beetle, overtook him,
Tisch, the lazy, idle dreamer,
Always asking foolish questions.
“Hold, my friend ” he droned out softly,
“Rest awhile beneath the pine tree;
Let us stop and talk together.
Tell me of your strange adventures;
What is in those hidden parcels,
That you stagger like a drunk man
2''
Then Lute-si-ah, lame and weary,
Weak and trembling 'neath his burden,
That grew heavier each moment,
Thought not
of
the spirits' warning,
Heeded not their words
of
caution ;
Sat down with the Tisch
togossip,
Opened up the magic parcels,
Lest his friend be disappointed,
•
When they opened
up the parcels,
Sudden darkness fell upon them ;
All the air was filled with music,
Filled with music and with fragrance.
Spirit voices whispered
tothem,
Whispered softly and
in

Class Poem,Leroy E. Jones,Jones,"All hail with joy the senior class, the  class of 1910, 
For four long years we labored hard, - the Art Degrees to win, 
But though the prize is in our grasp and we have won the race 
Our  minds are filled with tender thoughts, as we leave this dear place. 

The boys now think of old Clark Hall in which they often slept. 
The girls look back on Miner Hall, where social hours were kept. 
They both recall the chapel dear, for there God's words were taught. 
And hear anew that splendid choir, whose music wonders wrought. 

We next review old football games, with Union, Lincoln, Shaw, 
How we did yell for our home tean, and fill the air with rahs, * 
We saw them hit and plow the line, we saw them cross the goal, 
And cheered them as they won each game, for they were brave and bold. 

Ah, those were joyous, thrilling times, when might and skill did meet, 
To see which team would honor win, and which would receive defeat. 
Should we not praise our own dear team, since it surpassed thêm all 
And plainly showed to all the world, that we could play football? 

The great debates dart through our minds, here brains were put to test. 
We met Atlanta, Lincohı, Fisk, who fought us with their best. 
But better still were those they met, who fought for Howard's cause. 
So each in turn received defeat, while we received applause. 

Does this not prove beyond all doubt that Howard holds first place. 
Among her sister colleges, which educate our race? 
Does this not show she's moving on to greater, grander things, 
That she will soon toward any school her fearful challenge fling? 

Try as we may we can't forget the social times we had. 
In company with our college friends who.made our poor hearts glad. 
How tender are those memories now, since we from them must part. 
And somewhere in this great wide world, our life anew to start. 

Our minds now drift to class room. work, where knowledge did abound, 
Alas, we see our store is small, as leaving day roll's round. 
But learning is not useful now, if it is not applied, 
So we will use our little bit in some field it's desired
. 
Some way, of course good teachers make, because they can instruct. 
Some lawyers and physicians be, since they possess the pluck, 
What course indeed the rest may take, I can't with ease foretell, 
But this I hope, whate'er it is, that they may do it well. 

For all of us in battle line must fight our way through life, 
The conflict often will be fierge, uncertain oft the strife, 
But we must stand' like ingot steel, without a groan or sigh, 
And execute our class motto, To conquer or to die. 

Our wandering minds return at last, the time draws near to leave, 
We must express our parting thanks for benefits received, 
Our parting words must then be said, to teachers, mates friends, and 
Ere we depart from these dear walls, and college days shall end. 

God bless our noble president, who by his earnest zeal, 
Has roused our latest energies, and opened up new fields. 
The Science Hall, the new Library, are products of his works, 
And what we need now is a gym, let us this task not shirk. 

All honor to our noble Deans, for they built up the school, 
And dedicated life and thought to students as a rule. 
We thank them more for what they, did to make our lives refined. 
Than what they taught of calculus and other stuff combined. 

Let praises ring for teachers now, for they our thoughts did mold. 
And anything not clear to us they gladly did unfold, 
Although their tests were difficult, and oft much thought required. 
We managed to get by them all, and now we're satisfied. 

The saddest thae of all has come, we bid class-mates farewell, 
May all of us lead useful, lives, and ignorance dispel, 
Good by, dear Alma Mater, you, we shall e'er defend, 
Whate'er we do; where'er we be, the class of 1910.

The Vision,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"The Vision
By William Stanley Braithwaite

(McClure's Magazine for June.)

You are the vision, you are the image of the dream,
The voice among the stars, the silence in the stream;
A breath of the infinite poise, where space and time are spun,
And the circling orbits wheel their planets round the sun.
Beyond the outer margin where nothing calls to God
Leaps the fiery symbol to bloom wherever your feet have trod;
Here is the earth resurgent with color and bloom of spring,
Glorying the dream and the vision of the song you bring.

Joseph Pulitzer,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"Softly, quite softly—
For I hear, above the murmur of the sea,
Faint and far-fallen footsteps, as of One
Who comes from out beyond the endless ends of Time,
With voice that downwar d looms thro' singing stars;
Its subtle sound I see thro' these long - darkened eyes,
I hear the Light He bringeth on his hands—
Almight  Death! Softly, oh, softly, lest he pass me by,
And that unquivering Light toward which my longing soul
And tortured body through these years have writhed,
Fade to the dun darkness of my days.

Softly, full softly, let me rise and greet
The strong, low luting of that long - awaited call;
Swiftly be all my good and going gone,
And this vast veiled and vanquished vigor of my soul
Seek somehow otherwhere its rest and goal,
Where endless spaces stretch,
Where endless time doth moan,
Where endless light doth pour
Thro ' the black kingdoms of eternal death.

Then haply I may see what things I have not seen,
Then I may know what things I have not known;
Then may I do my dreams!
Farewell! No sound of idle mourning let there be
To shudder this full silence—save the voice
Of children—little children, white and black,
Whispering the deeds I tried to do for them;
While I at last unguided and alone
Pass—softly, full softly.

The Teacher,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"The Teacher

LORD, who am I to teach the way
To little children day by day,
So prone myself to go astray ?

I teach them knowledge, but I know
How faint they flicker and how low
The candles of my knowledge glow.

I teach them power to will and do,
But only now to learn anew
My own great weakness through and through .

I teach them love for all mankind
And all God's ceatures, but I find
My love comes lagging far behind.

Lord, if their guide I still must be,
Oh let the little children see
The teacher leaning hard on Thee.

The Heart's Desire,Robert W. Justice,Justice,"Float ever by me
In countless numbers,
Like waves in the mighty sea,
Strange faces of alien gaze,
Hurrying on to and from daily strife,
This way, and now that, yet all, all
Foreign, unfamiliar–still I stand and call 
In hushed breath, and wait for one
Who passeth by, never.
Yet I fear to leave my lonely place–
My watch-tower of delight where with me
Dwell Hope and Patience;
The one–sweet counseling voice–
Make days grow short, and I rejoice
When Patience laves my distressed soul
With reason and points to the goal
Where, though faint and dim,
I shall stand face to face,
And in love’s sweet embrace,
Fine and know My Heart's Desire.

My Little Love Salome,L.A. Proctor,Proctor,"I have wander’d late and early to the spot I love so dearly,
Where the scent of honeysuckle mingles with the tender rose.
There the incense sweet and holy sheathing me, I dreaming only
While a subtle spell fast held me as the mist above me posted.
A sweet fragrance as of clover all around me seem’d to hover.
While a secret power charmed me and my senses idly roam’d.
Then a magic something shower’d and a halo ‘round me flowered
While I courted fancy notions of my little love Salome. 
I have faced from climates warmer, white and dusky wily charmers,
And I’ve watched their flirting eyelash and their actions blithe or shy
But withal their fetching manner did not charm me nor enamor,
I saw nothing in their graces that was pleasing to my eye.
But the rose to me so sweetly cooing, loving so discreetly,
Sends a summons of devotion ev’ry place that I may roam.
For she is a gem completely, clad in robes precise and neatly.
And the bond of love is lasting between me and sweet Salome.

In God's Gardens,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"O mist-blown Lily of the north,
A-bnding southward in thy bloom,
And bringing beauty silver sown
And pale blue radiance of snows--

O fair white lily, bowin low,
Above the dream-swept poppy's mouth,
Athwart the black and crimson South--
Why dost thou fear--why dos thou fear? 

Lo! sense its sleep-sown subtle breath,
Where wheel in passioned whirl above
All lingering, luring love of love--
All perfume born of dole and deaht.

Cold ghost-wreathed Lily of the North,
When once thy dawning darkens there,
Come then with sunlight-sifted hair
And seek the haunting heaven of Night.

Where, over moon-mad shadows whirled,
The star-tanned mists dim swathe the sky
In phantasy to dream and die--
A wild sweetg wedding of the World.

Once more with spring's sweet growths are pied

I joyous roam the countryside.

Look, here the violets shy abide 
And there the mating robins hide—

      When April's here!

And list! down where the shimmering tide 
Hard by that farthest hill doth glide,

Vision of a Lyncher,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"[Written for The Crisis and dedicated to His Excellency, the Governor of South Carolina.]

Once looked I into hell--'twas in a trance
Throughout a horrid night of soul-wrought pain;
Down through the pit I saw the burning plain,
Where writhed tortured swarm without one glance
Upward to earth or God. There in advance 
Of all the rest was one with lips profane
And murderous, bloody hands, marked to be slain
by peers that would not bear him countance.
'God,' cried I in my dream, 'what soul is he
Doomed thus to drain the utmost cup of fate,
That even the cursed of Tartarus expel?'
And the great Voice replied: 'The chastity
Of dear, confiding Law he raped; now Hate,
His own begotten, drives him forth from hell.""",January,1912,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,"Lynching and Racialized Violence, Racism, Religion",,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/leslie-pinckney-hill-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Met A Little Blue-Eyed Girl,Bertha Johnston,Johnston,"A certain element in the South takes pains to rear the children of the family faithfully in the doctrines of Blease and Vardaman. 'A Negro had been lynched in the neighborhood,' said a recently returned traveler, 'and crowds went out to see what was left of his body. The people I was staying with went with the rest and took their children--all but one, who had been naughty and was kept home as a punishment.'

I met a little blue-eyed girl--
She said she was five years old;
'Your locket is very pretty dear;
And pray what may it hold?'
And then--my heart grew chill and sick--
The gay child did not flinch--
'I found it--the tooth of a colored man--
My father helped to lynch.'
'And what had he done, my fair-haired child?'
(Life and Death play a fearful game!)
'Oh, he did nothing--they made a mistake--
But they had their fun, just the same!'

Up! Sing the Song,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"I am a Negro, but I sing and sing,
   Burning with kiss divine that made me so.
   O brother mortal, likest to the snow,
Turn not in coldness from the song I bring,
But listen to my lyre's low murmuring,
   Where down the cypresses I sadly go,
   Through deepening twilight, lest the faint winds know
The secret of some tender little thing
That haunts and haunts me, and they tell it all--
   All, all my sorrows and ambitious, too.

The Road to the Bow,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Ever and ever and anon,
After the black storm, the eternal, beautous bow!
Brother, to rosy-painted mists that arch beyond,
Blithely I go.

My brown men laurled and my lyre
Twined with immortal ivy for one little rippling song;
My “House of Golden Leaves” they praised and “passionate fire”--
But, friend, the way is long!

Onward and onward, up! away!
Though Fear all his banners in my face,
And my feet stumble, lo! The Orphean day!
Forward by God’s grace!

These signs are still before me: “Fear”
“Danger”, “Unprecedented” and I hear black “No”
Still thundering and “Churl.” Good Friend,
I rest me here–
Then to the glittering bow!

Loometh and cometh Hate in wrath,
Mailed Wrong, swart Servitutde and Shame, with bitter rue,
Nathless a Negro poet’s feet must tread the path 
The winged god knew.

Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I
Forefend the anathema, following the span.
I hold my head as proudly high 
As any man.

At the Closed Gate of Justice,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"To be a Negro in a day like this

Betrayed, like him whose woe dimmed eyes gave bliss
  Still must one succor those who brought one low,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this
  Demands rare patience--patience that can wait
In utter darkness. 'Tis the path to miss,
  And knock, unheeded, at an iron gate,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this
  Demands strange loyalty. We serve a flag
Which is to us white freedom's emphasis.
  Ah! one must love when Truth and Justice lag,
To be a Negro in a day like this.

To be a Negro in a day like this--

Still shines the gate, all gold and amethyst,
  But I pass by, the glorious goal unwon,

Easter-Emancipation 1863-1913/ Children of the Moon,W.E.B. Du Bois,Du Bois,"I am dead;
Yet somehow, somewhere,
In Time's weird contradiction, I 
May tell of that dread deed, wherewith
I brought to Children of the Moon 
Freedom and vast salvation.

I was a woman born
And trod that streaming street
That ebbs and flows from Harlem's hills
Thro' caves and canyons limned in light
Down to the twisting sea.

That night of nights
I stood alone and at the End
Until the sudden highway to the Moon,
Golden in splendor,
Became too real to doubt.

Dimly I set foot upon the air;
I fled, I flew, thro' thrills of light,
With all about, above, below the whirring
Of almighty wings. I found a twilight land
Where, hardly hid, the sun
Sent softly saddened rays of
Red and brown to burn the iron earth
And bathe the snow-white peaks
In mighty splendor.

Black were the men,
Hard haired and silent slow,
Moving as shadows
Bending with face of fear to earthward;
And women there were none.

""Woman, woman, woman!""
I cried in mounting terror.
""Woman and Child!""
And the cry sang back
Thro' Heaven with the
Whirring of almighty wings.

Wings, wings, endless wings,
Heaven and earth are wings;
Wings that flutter, furl and fold,
Always folding and unfolding,
Ever folding yet again;
Wings, veiling some vast
And veiled face,
In blazing blackness,
Behind the folding and unfolding,
The rolling and unrolling of
Almighty wings!

I saw the black men huddle
Fumed in fear, falling face downward;
Vainly I clutched and clawed,
Dumbly they cringed and cowered,
Moaning in mournful monotone:
   O Freedom, O Freedom,
   O Freedom over me;
   Before I'll be a slave
   I'll be buried in my grave
   And go home to my God
   And be free.

It was as angel music
From the dead,
And ever, as they sang,
The winged Thing of wings, filling all Heaven,
Folding and unfolding, and folding yet again,
Tore out their blood and entrails
'Til I screamed in utter terror
And a silence came:
A silence and the wailing of a babe

Then at last I saw and shamed;
I knew how these dumb dark and dusky things
Had given blood and life
To fend the caves of underground
The great black caves of utter night
Where earth lay full of mothers
And their babes.

Little children sobbing in darkness.
Little children crying in silent pain.
Little mothers rocking and groping and struggling,
Digging and delving and groveling
Amid the dying-dead and dead-in-life.
And drip and dripping of warm, wet blood
Far, far beneath the wings.
The folding and unfolding of almighty wings.

I bent with tears and pitying hands
Above these dusky star-eyed children.
Crinkly haired, with sweet-sad baby voices
Pleading low for light and love and living— And I crooned:

   Little children weeping there,
   God shall find thy faces fair;
   Guerdon for thy deep distress.
   He shall send His tenderness;
   For the tripping of thy feet
   Make a mystic music sweet
   In the darkness of thy hair;
   Light and laughter in the air—
   Little children weeping there.
   God shall find thy faces fair!

I strode above the stricken bleeding men.
The rampart 'ranged against the skies.
And shouted:
""Up I say, build and slay;
Fight face foremost, force a way,
Unloose, unfetter and unbind;
Be men and free.""

Dumbly they shrank
Muttering they pointed toward that peak
Than vastness vaster,
Whereon a darkness brooded,
""Who shall look and live,"" they sighed;
And I sensed
The folding and unfolding of almighty wings

Yet did we build of iron, bricks and blood;
We built a day, a year, a thousand years.
Blood was the mortar,blood and tears
And, ah, the Thing, the Thing of wings,
The winged folding wing of Things,
Did furnish much mad mortar
For that tower.

Slow and ever slower rose the towering task
And with it rose the sun.
Until at last on one wild day,
Wind-whirled, cloud-swept and terrible.
I stood beneath the burning shadow
Of the peak.
Beneath the whirring of almighty wings
While downward from my feet
Streamed the long line of dusky faces
And the wail of little children sobbing under
Earth.

""Freedom! "" I cried.
""Freedom! "" cried Heaven, Earth and Stars,
And a Voice near-far
Amid the folding and unfolding of Almighty wings
Answered ""I am Freedom—
Who sees my face is free—
He and his.""

I dared not look;
Downward I glanced on deep bowed heads and closed eyes,
Outward I gazed on flecked and flaming blue—
But ever onward, upward flew
The sobbing of small voices;
Down, down, far down into the night.

Slowly I lifted livid limbs aloft;
Upward I strove:
The Face, the Face ;
Onward I reeled:
The Face, the Face!
To Beauty wonderful as sudden death
Or horror horrible as endless life—
Up! Up! the blood-built way
(Shadow grow vaster!
Terror come faster!)
Up ! Up to the blazing blackness
Of one veiled face
And endless folding and unfolding,
Rolling and unrolling of Almighty wings:
The last step stood!
The last dim cry of pain
Fluttered across the stars—
And then—

Wings, wings, triumphant wings,
Lifting and lowering, waxing and waning,
Swinging and swaying, twirling and whirling,
Whispering and screaming, streaming and gleaming,
Spreading and sweeping and shading and flaming—
Wings, wings, eternal wings,
'Til the hot red blood Flood fleeing flood,
Thundered thro' Heaven and mine ears
While all across a purple sky
The last vast pinion
Trembled to unfold.

I rose upon the Mountain of the Moon;
I felt the blazing glory of the Sun.
I heard the Song of Children crying ""Free!""
I saw the Face of Freedom—
And I died.

Fifty Years,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"O brothers mine, to-day we stand
      Where half a century sweeps our ken,
    Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,
      Struck off our bonds and made us men.
    Just fifty years--a winter's day--
      As runs the history of a race;
    Yet, as we look back o'er the way,
      How distant seems our starting place!
    Look farther back! Three centuries!
      To where a naked, shivering score,
    Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
      Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.
    Far, far the way that we have trod,
      From heathen kraals and jungle dens,
    To freedmen, freemen, sons of God,
      Americans and Citizens.
    A part of His unknown design,
      We've lived within a mighty age;
    And we have helped to write a line
      On history's most wondrous page.
    A few black bondmen strewn along
      The borders of our eastern coast,
    Now grown a race, ten million strong,
      An upward, onward marching host.
    Then let us here erect a stone,
      To mark the place, to mark the time;
    A witness to God's mercies shown,
      A pledge to hold this day sublime.
    And let that stone an altar be,
      Whereon thanksgivings we may lay,
    Where we, in deep humility,
      For faith and strength renewed may pray.
    With open hearts ask from above
      New zeal, new courage and new pow'rs,
    That we may grow more worthy of
      This country and this land of ours.
    For never let the thought arise
      That we are here on sufferance bare;
    Outcasts, asylumed 'neath these skies,
      And aliens without part or share.
    This land is ours by right of birth,
      This land is ours by right of toil;
    We helped to turn its virgin earth,
      Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
    Where once the tangled forest stood,--
      Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,--
    Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
      The cotton white, the yellow corn.
    To gain these fruits that have been earned,
      To hold these fields that have been won,
    Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
      Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
    That Banner which is now the type
      Of victory on field and flood--
    Remember, its first crimson stripe
      Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.
    And never yet has come the cry--
      When that fair flag has been assailed--
    For men to do, for men to die,
      That have we faltered or have failed.
    We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,
      Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze;
    Held in our hands, it has been borne
      And planted far across the seas.
    And never yet--O haughty Land,
      Let us, at least, for this be praised--
    Has one black, treason-guided hand
      Ever against that flag been raised.
    Then should we speak but servile words,
      Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
    Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
      And fear our heritage to claim?
    No! stand erect and without fear,
      And for our foes let this suffice--
    We've bought a rightful sonship here,
      And we have more than paid the price.
    And yet, my brothers, well I know
      The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
    The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
      The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
    The staggering force of brutish might,
      That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
    The long, vain waiting through the night
      To hear some voice for justice raised.
    Full well I know the hour when hope
      Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere

(On the Anniversary of Lincoln's Birth)

    Father, Father Abraham,
      To-day look on us from above;
    On us, the offspring of thy faith,
      The children of thy Christ-like love.
    For that which we have humbly wrought,
      Give us to-day thy kindly smile;
    Wherein we've failed or fallen short,
      Bear with us, Father, yet awhile.
    Father, Father Abraham,
      To-day we lift our hearts to thee,
    Filled with the thought of what great price
      Was paid, that we might ransomed be.
    To-day we consecrate ourselves
      Anew in hand and heart and brain,
    To send this judgment down the years:
      The ransom was not paid in vain.

That One Might Live in the Sunlight Glad,William H.A. Moore,Moore,"That one might live in the sunlight glad
   And know the day;
That one might dream in the shadows 
   And love alway.
To love and to live and to know,
To feel the sea's strength and sea's flow,
That one might sleep while the heart is mad
   And sorrow play!
that one might speak when the soul's athirst
   And hear the cry;
That one might feel when the heart has burst
  And love the why.
O to speak and to feel and to know,
O to love the wind's strength and wind's blow,
That one might walk with the sorrows first,

"Listen, O Isles!",James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"LISTEN, O ISLES!* 
[An appreciation of the Philippine Constabulary Band, organized by a Negro, Captain Loving, through the suggestion of former President Taft.] 

 I. 
Swirled over-most by Titan winds that toss
Their limbs and ringlets in the eddying air.
Like death-loosed poets, with their breeze-blown hair,
Hymning to mountains, precipice and palm,
Or sighing soft as Seraph's evening psalm—
Startled by storm burst; stilled in love's deep loss,
Listen, O Dream Isles of the Orient Main,
Thy brown elves wake and pour lost Eden's choral strain! 

II.
Thrilled by brown magi from the nymphean coves.
Old nations sing as if the centuries
Sighed to the stars some old, lost planet's love;
Now Egypt breathes: now Babylon, Persia, Greece,
Through these soft pipes, wake, sighing, like the groves
Where gods have wandered, and where winds are whispering ""Peace.""
But hear the flute's sweet eccentricities
'Neath the white moon, you castled stream above,
Till crash of cymbals, turban'd Turks have known,
And sound's fine rain, and booming of deep drums,
(And the brown gnome who pursueth wind gusts through
Old Triton's wreathed shell, he wakes anew—
Bellowing, like Neptune's rage, with much ado),
Drown, with their ocean roar, the little bird
Whose notes, like dainty Ariel's, laughed that they were heard.
Was it Adonis, wandering alone,
Waked, with sweet lips, the silver piccolo,
Fair Music's nightingale, which sang: ""Mine own,
Mine own, dear Love, dost thou not know; not know?""
Now, o'er the hills, is it Apollo comes,
Pouring (oh, hear!) sound's golden honey down could drown
Those silver reeds whose notes go down to some
Well's bottom, over crystal rocks?Oh, come!
Hear music ripple, like a breeze that's blown
O'er ripening fields and Daphne's rosy vale,
Full, deep and resonant! Hear this rose gale
Of June's sweet Calliope wake, and all
The muses rouse from dreamy murmurings!
Hear shout and revel; romp and tipsy call
Of woodland fairies. List! What siren sings
O'er ocean voicings— deep, divinely deep!
What billowed tempests rage; what surge and sweep;
What equal thunderings storm Poseidon's throne,
And sound Earth's black abyss! Now Ares fires
The clouds, and far his awful symphony fills
The world. 'Tis war! Embattled Harmony Sends
Echo flying, golden, to the hills,
To win brave heights where the winged eagle tires.
And oh! the battle music rageth gloriously!
Till, victory won, a last loud bar begins
With roll of kettledrums, like boom of bees that drone,
On heavy wings, down sultry summer winds,
And unmolested bays where love sees one white sail. 

III.

And what of him who leads these happy fauns?
This Afric' Pan who broke the crystal lip
Of Sound's lost river; plashed there, and let drip
Thy soul, O Islands, mystical and sweet,
Through reeds that bowed and nodded at Taft's feet,
Fair and unbroken, 'mid the clamorous
Dawn's Cry and appealings? Courage, O my race! 
Courage and patience, Islands; ye shall yet have place!

A Song of May and June,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"Oh sweet, as an orient 'Maid o' the moon,'
   With wild roses in her dark hair,
Entranced by the magical minstrel June,
   May stands in her garden fair.

For June, the herald of summer gay,
   Is prince of its minstrelsy;
And never a monarch of ancient day
   Wore gaudier robes than he.
Over the hills comes the minstrel June,
   Perfuming and thrilling the air;
Sweet may will sink on his breast a-swoon, 
   And die as he holds her there.

Certainty,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"What have I fathomed of life,
What of its medley of strife,
Sorrow and solace profound?
What can we creatures of dust
Stand upon, swear by and trust,
What my unshakable ground?
This: that though evil be strong,
Goodness prevaileth ere long
However betrayed or beset;
That he his own spirit doth smother,
Who willeth the hurt of another;
And this : that God liveth yet.

A Lullaby,Cora J. Ball Moten,Moten,"Dusky lashes droop and fall,
Night-winds whisper, night-birds call.
Close your tired sleepy eyes,
Earth is singing lullabies,
Kindly twilight shadows creep
O’er a world that longs for sleep,
Little dusky babe of mine
Close those sleepy eyes of thine,
Mother’s love will softly keep 
Watch above you while you sleep,
Cruel hate and deadly wrong
Cannot silence mother’s song
Though against thy soft brown cheek
She may hide her face and weep.
Sleep, brown baby, while you may
Peacefully, at close of day.
Oh, that mother’s love could guard,
Keep thee safe ‘neath watch and ward
From the cruelly deadly things 
That await thee while she sings.
Prejudice and cold white hate:
These, my baby, these, thy fate,
Little, gentle, trustful thing, 
Thus, these sobs, the while I sing.

King Cotton and the Negro,Jasper Ross,Ross,"With brawny arms the negro stands,
Uplifting in his sable hands 
King Cotton; while about him grow
The pretty buds as white as snow.
His arms alone support, sustain,
His royal person while he reigns,
Exalt, ye nations that be prone,
Him who thus stands beneath the throne
For lo, what danger! what alarm!
Should he withdraw his mighty arm.
Pray, what if he should take away
That pow’r which gives King Cotton sway
O’er all the world; for by his right 
He can withhold that which would be blight
The nations all upon the globe.
For though he may not wear the robe,
Nor on the regal throne may sit,
He is the king; though black quite fit;
Despite illit’racy and birth,
To wield the scepter o’er the earth.

Strong spirits must awaken! for the time,
Unhealthy with a bitter sick unrest
That ne'er relaxes in our fevered breast,
Bids that we, Godlike, rise above the crime
That sullies the still beauty of our time,
That makes a noble state seem still unblest,
Because her weaker brothers find no rest,
But wearied, labor in a cause sublime.
Come forth! ye deep-voices star-souled men,
And o'er the sounding land raise high your song,
Sing o'er and o'er the truth you love again,
To tame the terror of this fearful wrong,
Teach deep inwrought the power of love through all,

Laughing it Out,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"He had a whim, and laughted it out
   Upon the exit of a chance;
He floundered in a sea of doubt--
   If life was real--or just romance.

Sometimes upon his brow would come
   A little pucker of defiance;
He totalled in a word the sum
   If life was real--or just romance.

And then a hearty laugh would break,
   A reasoning shrug of shoulder;
And we would from his fancy take
   A faith in death which made life bolder.

Shakespeare,Benjamin Griffith Brawley,Brawley,"I thought how ofte the great gray god of years,
Swinging adown the dark abysm of time,
Some lamp portentous in the dimness rears,
Some taper high, ineffable, sublime:
Now darts a gleam faint thrilling through the deep,
And now a glimmer from archangels' wings;
And then once more the mighty aeons sleep,
Lost in the slumber that the darkness brings;
And then I creamed of one Promethean light,
That, throbbing, as a mystic searchlight blazed
Through all the caverns. Nature leaped in might
To greet the signal from the rampart raised;
Her innocent heart at last a flame inquired;
And one by one all other lights expired.

In the Matter of Two Men,James D. Corrothers,Corrothers,"One does such work as one will not,
  And well each knows the right;
Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,
  The black must serve the white.
And it's, oh, for the white man's softening flesh,
  While the black man's muscles grow!
Well I know which grows the mightier,
  I know; full well I know.
The white man seeks the soft, fat place,
  And he moves and he works by rule.
Ingenious grows the humbler race
  In Oppression's prodding school.
And it's, oh, for a white man gone to seed,
  While the Negro struggles so!
And I know which race develops most,
  I know; yes, well I know.
The white man rides in a palace car,
  And the Negro rides ""Jim Crow.""
To damn the other with bolt and bar,
  One creepeth so low; so low!
And it's, oh, for a master's nose in the mire,
  While the humbled hearts o'erflow!
Well I know whose soul grows big at this,
  And whose grows small; I know!
The white man leases out his land,
  And the Negro tills the same.
One works; one loafs and takes command;
  But I know who wins the game!
And it's, oh, for the white man's shrinking soil,
  As the black's rich acres grow!
Well I know how the signs point out at last,
  I know; ah, well I know!
The white man votes for his color's sake,
  While the black, for his is barred;
(Though ""ignorance"" is the charge they make),
  But the black man studies hard.
And it's, oh, for the white man's sad neglect,
  For the power of his light let go!

To Keep The Memory of Charlotte Forten Grimke,Angelina W. Grimke,Grimke,"Still are there wonders of the dark and day:
   The muted shrilling of shy things at night,
      So small beneath the stars and moon;
   The peace, dream-frail, but perfect while the light
      Lies softly on the leaves at noon.
         These are, and these will be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

Each dawn, while yet the east is veiléd grey,
   The birds about her window wake and sing;
      And far away, each day, some lark
   I know is singing where the grasses swing;
      Some robin calls and calls at dark.
         These are, and these will be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

The wild flowers that she loved down green ways stray;
   Her roses lift their wistful buds at dawn,
      But not for eyes that loved them best;
   Only her little pansies are all gone,
      Some lying softly on her breast.
         And flowers will bud and be
             Until eternity;
But she who loved them well has gone away.

Where has she gone? And who is there to say?
   But this we know: her gentle spirit moves
      And is where beauty never wanes,
   Perchance by other streams, mid other groves;
      And to us there, ah! she remains
         A lovely memory
             Until eternity;
She came, she loved, and then she went away.

The Black Man's Burden,Hubert Harrison,Harrison,"Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Send forth the worst ye breed,
And bind our sons in shackles
To serve your selfish greed.

To wait in heavy harness,
Be-deviled and beguiled
Until the Fates Remove you
From a world you have defiled.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Your lies may still abide
To veil the threat of terror,
And check our racial pride;

Your cannon, church and courthouse
May still our sons constrain
To seek the white man’s profit
And work the white man’s gain.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Reach out and hog the earth,
And leave your workers hungry
In the country of their birth.

Then, when your goal is nearest,
The end for which you fought,
Watch Teuton trained efficiency
Bring all your hope for nought.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Reduce their chiefs and kings
To toil of serf and sweeper,
The lot of common things.

Sodden their soil with slaughter
Ravish their lands with lead;
Go, sign them with your living
And seal them with your dead.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
And keep your old reward;
The curse of those ye cozen,
The hate of those ye barred

From your Canadian cities
And your Australian ports;
And when they ask for meat and drink,
Go, girdle them with forts.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Ye cannot stoop to less.
Will not your fraud of freedom
Still cloak your greediness?

But, by the gods ye worship,
And by the deeds ye do,
These silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.

Take up the Black Man’s burden—
Until the tale is told,
Until the balances of hate
Bear down the beam of gold.

And while ye wait, remember
That Justice, though delayed,
Will hold you as her debtor, till
The Black Man’s debt is paid.",December ,1915,Colored American Review,R.G. Doggett,,male,"Intertext, Empire",,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Harrison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Armageddon,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"Armageddon

Written at the outbreak of the World War ,just after President Wilson's appeal to the country for a ""poise of undisturbed judgment,” — to express the significance to the trammeled millions of colored people the world over, and especially to the American Negro, of that spirit of the times which well nigh destroyed civilization.

""Where is the wise? where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? . But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise: and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which arc despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence.""— Paul.

""What is all this but a wild fermentation of the spirit, wherefrom, the fiercer it is, the clearer product will one day evolve itself.""—Carlyle

BEFORE the whirlwind and the thunder shock,
The agony of nations, and this wild
Eruption of the passionate will of man,
These tottering bastions of mighty states,
This guillotine of culture, and this new
Unspeakable Golgotha of the Christ,
My heart declares her faith, and, undismayed,
I write her prompting—write it in that poise
Of judgment undisturbed to which our Head
Admonishes the nation.

                                But have I
A certain warrant? Does the cannon roar
Above the mangled myriads washed in blood
Upon a hundred fields embolden me
To vent the doctrine of a private heart !
Nay, ask it not, for God hath chosen still
The weak thing, and the foolish, and the base,
And that which is despised to work His will;
And humble men are chartered yet to run
Upon His errands round the groaning sphere.
Not many of the mighty shall be called,
Not many that dispute, not many wise,
That so the prophecy may be fulfilled.
Among the least of men of many strains,
Whose origin outdates the pyramids,
Uncherished of my country — though the blood
Of all my fathers ran to make her free
Known by a name that typifies the slave,
Synonymous with darkness, and by that
Set in the ranks of mortals least esteemed,
I claim no merit save the love of truth,
And care to find for her a lodging- place.
I have been bred and born beneath the stern
Duress and cold inhospitality
Of that environment which prejudice
Fills consciously with bane; and I have sought
Blessed be the God of mercy — at the shrine
Of thought inviolate the wells of peace.

There, fortified and unmolested, long
Have I in contemplation rued the plight
Of all my kind, and reverently aspired
To ponder out our mission, unconvinced
That we are born the dupes of Providence,
To be a nation's burden and her taunt,
Or Ishmaels of an unchosen land.

My quest has been to know the good of life,
And why a race should be, and what endures
Of that which man has called society,
And - last and highest aim of these pursuits
To learn what perfect service, born of throes
Dreadful but purgative, we yet might dare
To offer thee, O country of our hope.
And from these musings — thanks to Him
Whose citadels are stars, with time and space
Their pylons, but Who builds His favored home
Upon the docile trust of lowly hearts
Proceeded comfort, patience to endure,
And strength increasing of a faith sublime
Which neither infidelity in arms,
Nor all the bitter usage of the world
Can e'er avail to tarnish or impair.
For looking out upon the world I saw
No hope for future man in those who stand
Upon the heights of power, save in the tales
Transmitted of their slow decline and fall.
Because they spurn the truth of brotherhood,
And trade in life, and mock the living God
By high contempt of all His humbler sons,
The strong battalions of eternal right
And nature's law make their discomfort sure.

They prove the error of that pride of race
And nation which has been the world's despite,
And unloosed Mammon for a thousand years.
Not all their transient lordship of the earth,
Their cunning in the traffic of the world,
The condescension of their patronage,
Or thundering proclamations of their might,
Can check the springs of pity, while our prayers
Besiege the throne of mercy for their weal.

But looking in upon my stricken peers,
I saw upon their swarthy brows “the gleam;""
I saw the lineaments of hope new-born
For peoples yet to be. O scorn it not,
Ye mighty of all lands, ye that are raised
To glory on the necks of trampled men !
For now within your midst are multitudes
Puissant though despised, meek men of prayer,
Dark, shackled knights of labor, clinging still
Amidst a universal wreck of faith
To cheerfulness, and foreigners to hate.
These know ye not, these have ye not received,
But these shall speak to you Beatitudes.

Around them surge the tides of all your strife,
Above them rise the august monuments
Of all your outward splendor, but they stand
Unenvious in thought, and bide their time.
Because ye schooled them in the arts of life,
And gave to them your God, and poured your blood
Into their veins to make them what they are,
They shall not fail you in your hour of need.

They hold in them enough of you to feel
All that has made you masters in your time
The power of art and wealth, unending toil,
Proud types of beauty, an unbounded will
To triumph, wondrous science, and old law
These have they learned to value and to share.
But deeper in them still is something steeled
To hot abhorrence and unmeasured dread
Of your undaunted sins against the light
Red sins of lust, of envy and of greed,
Of guilty gain extorted from the weak,
Of brotherhood traduced and God denied.

All this have they beheld without revolt,
And borne the brunt in agonizing prayer.
For those deep strains of blood that flow from times
Older than Egypt, whence the dark man gave
The rudiments of learning to all lands,
Have been a strong constraint. And they have dreamed
Of a peculiar mission under heaven,
And felt the force of unexampled gifts
That make for them a rare inheritance
The gift of cheerful confidence in men,
The gift of calm endurance, solacing
An infinite capacity for pain,
The gift of an unfeigned humility
That blinds the eyes of strident arrogance
And bigot pride to that philosophy
And that far-glancing wisdom which it veils,
The gift of feeling for all forms of life,
Of deathless hope in trouble, and of wide
Adaptive power without a parallel
In chronicles of men, and over all,
And more than all besides, the gift of God
Expressed in rhythmic miracles of song.

O these are gifts, I said a thousand times
Richer than Ophir, stronger than the might
Of armament to conquer and to cure
Gifts destined yet to permeate the earth,
To heal it of its mighty heresies,
And all its brutal blasphemy of war.
So viewing all my brothers in distress,
Hindered and cursed and aliens, I have wept
And prayed for them in solitude apart,
That they might know themselves a chosen folk,
Unrecognized but potent, chastened still,
But chartered to be ministers of truth,
To search the depths of spirit, to go forth
To woo and win a perfect self-control,
To breed strong children exercised in prayer,
Shunning as they would death the patterns set
By those who hold the kingdoms and the sway.
So might they with the pregnant years become
New arbiters of social destiny,
New health veins in the body politic,
A high-commissioned people, mingled through
With all the bloods of man, and, counselling
Peace, and the healing grace of brotherhood,
""Have power in this dark world to lighten it,
And power in this dead world to make it live.""

When through my being, like a lyre strung,
These winds of temporal occurrence sweep,
I hear a kind of music, high and low,
And ranging from the tortured earth to heaven,
Throbbing with tragic cadence to express
The passing and the coming life of man .
And though the tempests rage and earth be stirred
To her foundations, though the lucid air
Become a menace, and the beauteous world
Be bathed in fire, I am undismayed.
The cataclysmic travail prophecies
The dawn of one world-conscience for all men,
The breaking up of caste and race and creed,
The warfare of all war against itself.
And hence in my low place this living peace
That grows and deepens, while the staggered frames
Of ancient kingdoms reel beneath a weight
Of crimes so vast that genius strives in vain
To compass them in thought: for out of this,
The spirit saith, shall issue other breeds
Soul-burdened like my brothers, and like them
Despised and trammeled, but sent forth to teach
That nothing in the changing world endures
But truth and love and brotherhood and God .",June,1915,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,"World War I, Religion, Racism",,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/leslie-pinckney-hill-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The White Witch,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!    
The great white witch rides out to-night.    
Trust not your prowess nor your strength,    
Your only safety lies in flight;    
For in her glance there is a snare,            
And in her smile there is a blight.    
 
The great white witch you have not seen?    
Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,    
Like nursery children you have looked    
For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;            
But no, not so; the witch appears    
In all the glowing charms of youth.    
 
Her lips are like carnations, red,    
Her face like new-born lilies, fair,    
Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,            
She moves with subtle grace and air,    
And all about her head there floats    
The golden glory of her hair.    
 
But though she always thus appears    
In form of youth and mood of mirth,            
Unnumbered centuries are hers,    
The infant planets saw her birth;    
The child of throbbing Life is she,    
Twin sister to the greedy earth.    
 
And back behind those smiling lips,            
And down within those laughing eyes,    
And underneath the soft caress    
Of hand and voice and purring sighs,    
The shadow of the panther lurks,    
The spirit of the vampire lies.            
 
For I have seen the great white witch,    
And she has led me to her lair,    
And I have kissed her red, red lips    
And cruel face so white and fair;    
Around me she has twined her arms,            
And bound me with her yellow hair.    
 
I felt those red lips burn and sear    
My body like a living coal;    
Obeyed the power of those eyes    
As the needle trembles to the pole;            
And did not care although I felt    
The strength go ebbing from my soul.    
 
Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,    
And heard your laughter loud and gay,    
And in your voices she has caught            
The echo of a far-off day,    
When man was closer to the earth;    
And she has marked you for her prey.    
 
She feels the old Antaean strength    
In you, the great dynamic beat            
Of primal passions, and she sees    
In you the last besieged retreat    
Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,    
Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.    
 
O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!            
The great white witch rides out to-night.    
O, younger brothers mine, beware!    
Look not upon her beauty bright;    
For in her glance there is a snare,    
And in her smile there is a blight. ",March,1915,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,,male,Interracial,The Book of American Negro Poetry,New York,Predom. Black,"https://poets.org/poet/james-weldon-johnson#:~:text=Johnson%20wrote%20and%20edited%20numerous,a%20year%20later%20by%20The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fettered Liberty,Esther A. Yates ,Yates,"To come so near, and yet not touch the goal!
   To sight!
Its gleaming bars, like some pale pilgrim soul 
      Hails light,
   After the weary night.
To feel the unbounded joy! My efforts crowned
   At last!

Then strive to leap, and find my feet are bound,
      And fast;
   My short-lived freedom past!
To see my fond hopes crumble as do things In dreams; 
My skin a burden that should serve as wings!
      It seems 
   The earth with passion teems!

To live with the books, to teach my eager brain
      To act,
And every noble power and gift to train 
      With tact–
   Then meet this time-worn fact:

That prejudicial bars rise everywhere.
      My race,
My barrier. For this my soul must bear
      Disgrace,
   And opposition face. 

How long shall I restrain the hot life-tide
      Whose flow
With just resentment surges? Must I bide 
      This blow?
And this? And this? And fearful hide?
      And cringing terror show?

Or shall I let the prejudice of  years 
      Go by,
With outward passivness, and inward tears,
      And die? 
Or leave unsatisfied my tears,
      Nor even question why?

And this is freedom? This is liberty?
      The place
Where justice reigns? “Home of the brave and and free”?
      Look! Trace
The deepened furrows of servility 
      Upon a burdened race!

Jehovah, burn into our faith’s weak ray
      Thy might.
We crave but half a chance to blaze a way 
      To light,
   To dawn, from racial night.

God of a trampled race! We must, we dare
      Be free!
Free, that we may be men! We leave our fare 
      With thee. 
If only in the battles wear and tear,
Thou’ll lead our host through fog or noon-day glare
      To freedom! Liberty!

The Washer-Woman,Otto Bohanan,Bohanan,"A great swart cheek and the gleam of tears,
The flutter of hopes and the shadow of fears,
And all day long the rub and scrub
With only a breath betwixt tub and tub.
Fool! Thou hast toiled for fifty years
And what hast thou now but thy dusty tears?
In silence she rubbed . . . But her face I had seen,
Where the light of her soul fell shining and clean.

Disorderly of feature, crowned with stubborn hair.

Fall full against the window pane. 
On such a day, the fire aglow,
An easy chair, a book or so,–

And close to heart and hearth I fold 
My friend, who guessed my wish untold.
For other joys I do not pray,
Content am I this rainy day.

Black Samson of Brandywine,Paul Laurence Dunbar,Dunbar,"In the fight at Brandywine, Black Samson, a giant negro
armed with a scythe, sweeps his way thro' the red ranks""
--C. M. Skinner's ""Myths and Legends of Our Own Land.

Gray are the pages of record,
Dim are the volumes of eld;
Else had old Delaware told us
More that her history held.
Told us with pride in the story,
Honest and noble and fine,
More of the tale of my hero,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

Sing of your chiefs and your nobles,
Saxon and Celt and Gaul,
Breath of mine ever shall join you,
Highly I honor them all.
Give to them all of their glory,
But for this noble of mine,
Lend him a tithe of your tribute,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

There in the heat of the battle,
There in the stir of the fight,
Loomed he, an ebony giant,
Black as the pinions of night.
Swinging his scythe like a mower
Over a field of grain,
Needless the care of the gleaners,
Where he had passed amain.

Straight through the human harvest,
Cutting a bloody swath,
Woe to you, soldier of Briton!
Death is abroad in his path.
Flee from the scythe of the reaper,
Flee while the moment is thine,
None may with safety withstand him,
Black Samson of Brandywine.

Was he a freeman or bondman?
Was he a man or a thing?
What does it matter? His brav'ry
Renders him royal -- a king.
If he was only a chattel,
Honor the ransom may pay
Of the royal, the loyal black giant
Who fought for his country that day.

Noble and bright is the story,
Worthy the touch of the lyre,
Sculptor or poet should find it
Full of the stuff to inspire.
Beat it in brass and in copper,
Tell it in storied line,
So that the world may remember
Black Samson of Brandywine.

Just a Little Tired,Katherine Gillard,Gillard,"Katharine Gilliard “Just a Little Tired” 

Just a little tired, waiting
Through the night
For the new day to be breaking 
Into light.
Just a little tired, yearning
For the blast 
In the land of no returning
God-and rest.
Just a little tired, trying
Yet again–
To smile and cease the crying 
Through the pain.
Just a little tired, bending
“Neath the rod,
Though the rough, bleak way is wending 
Up to God.
Just a little tired, facing
Blows that fall
Unexpected; tired placing
Trust in all.
Just a little tired, falling–
Blund’ring here.
Ideals gone beyond recalling
Friends once dear. 
Just a little tired, waiting
Through the night 
For the new morn to be breaking
Clear and bright.

Brothers,James Weldon Johnson,Johnson,"See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter's trap.

How came this beast in human shape and form?
Speak, man! - We call you man because you wear
His shape-How are you thus? Are you not from
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
Which we have known three centuries? Not from
That more than faithful race which through three wars
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!

   I am, and am not.
      Then who, why are you?
   I am a thing not new, I am as old

As human nature. I am that which lurks,
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
The ancient trait which fights incessantly
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
The weight forever seeking to obey
The law of downward pull; and I am more:
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
   Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
Filtered through fifteen generations have
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
In me the muttered curse of dying men,
On me the stain of conquered women, and
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
Of wretches now long dead,--their dire bequests,--
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their bartered mothers' breasts.

I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
I am-just what I am . . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
To-day, but I -
Enough, the brute must die!
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
The fire much longer than this slender pine.
Now bring the fuel! Pile it 'round him! Wait!
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
And there's another! Wilder than the first.
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
Searching around in vain appeal for help!
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.

Stop! to each man no more than one man's share.
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain -
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
In fair division, to the leader comes.

And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
Let us back to our wives and children. - Say,
What did he mean by those last muttered words,
'Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we'?

Retribution,Ida B. Luckie,Luckie,"Alas, My Country! Thou wilt have no need
Of enemy to bring thee to thy doom
If these be they on whom we must rely
To prove the right and honor of our arms."" 
Thus spake Abdullah, gazing, with sad eyes
And heart fear-stricken, on the motley horde
Of Turks now gathered in with feverish haste
To meet the dread, on-coming Bulgar host.
Truly he spake, for scarce the foes had met
When the wild flight began, the vengeful sword
Of the Bulgarian taking fearful toll
As fleeing thousands fall to rise no more.
Surely the years bring on the fatal day
To that dark land, from whose unhallowed ground
The blood of countless innocents so long
Has cried to God, nor longer cries in vain. 
But not alone by war a nation falls.
Tho' she be fair, serene as radiant morn,
Tho' girt by seas, secure in armament,
Let her but spurn the Vision of the Cross;
Tread with contemptuous feet on its command
Of Mercy, Love and Human Brotherhood,
And she, some fateful day, shall have no need
Of enemy to bring her to the dust.
Some day, tho' distant it may be—with God
A thousand years are but as yesterday—
The germs of hate, injustice, violence,
Like an insidious canker in the blood,
Shall eat the nation's vitals. She shall see
Break forth the blood-red tide of anarchy,
Sweeping her plains, laying her cities low,
And bearing on its seething, crimson flood
The wreck of government, of home, and all
The nation's pride, its splendor and its power;
On, with relentless flow, into the sea
Of God's eternal vengeance wide and deep,
But for God's grace! Oh, may it hold thee fast,
My Country, until justice shall prevail
O'er wrong and o'er oppression's cruel power,
And all that makes humanity to mourn.

"Lo, the Dusk-Born Daughter!",B. Harrison Peyton,Peyton,"I. 
Lo, my Heart, behold! a girl of modest brown
Is gliding down the paths of our town!
Clings not round her the aura of the morning-child;
For mark, Heart, she came not while
Aurora smiled In silver effusion on the lucid air;
Her figure is not dawn-pale, nor is her hair
Fine-spun of sun-gold into a Phoebean crown!
O Eyes, she is some quickened bronze,
Which transformed to skin of finest texture,
Unto the sense as exquisitely responds
As any gloss of silk or softness of a plush!
But nay, frail Eyes; trust not the groping, blind conjecture!
Ah! tell my Heart by what mutations
Could bronze be turned half so ravishingly lush,
So ripened into rich refreshing fruit as is this girl?
And furthermore, I ask you, Eyes, e'en tho' it were toothed
Of ivory or milky-clouded pearl,
As preciously cut and delicately smoothed
As are her teeth, what mold of bronze—bronze cumbrous and cold—
Could make upon my soul, oh! such enthralling seizure 
As do these luxuriant beauties which some would dare hold
Were but a darkling blush of shame? 
II.
Ah, no, Heart, 'twas of lowly, peaceful dusk God wrought her,
And of benignities that the lofty spheres brought her;
She is of Vesper, child and anointed daughter!
Look! how all the charms of twilight gather to her frame,
And the shades of tropics haunt her lissome shape!
Ay, too, lambent stars are twinkling, e'en when noon's aflame;
Here her crinkling, night-like tresses the gloaming drape.
Soul, gaze her quiet eyes! From what divine skies
Did they, with placid allure of dusk, escape—
These amber haze-beams that, as if ordained, transfigure, 
And with soft halos flush her every lovely feature?
Bewitched Soul, how they mark her perfect, dusk-born creature! 
III.
Thus veined with angel-gossamers floated down
By the eventide, she is become a blessed vision—
Verily, O Soul! Soul! a miracle of brown!
As closer now she comes, oh! mark each luster
Which ripples in a sheen o'er the swarthness that is swirled
About her from pale finger-nail to eye-lash thick-curled! 
Soul, infinitely happy harmonies are
Thus bodied by her in tender, gleamy dark! 
IV.
Ay, she carries the dim spirit of the vesper-star;
And thence it comes that her sympathies impart
To shadow-purpled nightingales the dreaming of her heart
Which so elatedly he sings to rapt-hark'ning lark!
So breathe, Heart, breathe the fragrances that cluster
Round that sweet, peerless bower of her flesh whence she wafts
The warm, reposeful shade of the holy palm
And such meady dews as flavor lands of southern calm!
And drink, Heart! O Heart! drink of Elysian balm
Which her elixir-like touch brings in redolent drafts
From nightward nectaries that have their place
In lunar regions of supernal space!
And then, my Heart, let your every vibrant fiber sense
The essence, as it were, of oenomel which seems thence
To lave its haze on her delicious face,
Where is set, like a red-brown kiss, the mouth that quaffs
Its flow—oh! blissful flow the nectaries dispense
To but her who, by divine right of race, 
Is twilight vestal, and to eve enchantress-daughter
And purest cast of gloam in fluent grace of water! 
V.
God! shall lewd flames count wanton, wind-raked husk
This girl whose nature heaves such sacred spells of dusk?
Love! O true Love! how chaste with cloistral sundown
And ways that breathe rosy airs of saintly musk, 
Oh! she must be, since that her being wears for gown
Heav'n's own highness in pure glows of auburn brown! 
VI.
Thus she moves zephyr-like in virgin grace of leisure!
And since she is sylphine-imbued with nightfall 'that drowns
Earth in ethereal tides of marvelous browns,
How meet it is that her feet, O Columbian World,
Are given to thread your occidental spread!
Why then, mad World, are persecutive shadows thus hurled
Before her feet? E'en so, World, behold! tho' meek and demure,
Yet she walks in stanch and serene procedure,
Unfaltering in her fortitude and gentle state,
Towards far horizons where, beaconing, there wait
For her more golden triumphs than any sunset has!
Ay, her way leads through dread labyrinths of hate, 
Mid trails of scorn pythonic, and minotaurs of wrath,
But like the dusk, she walks above her earthly path! 
VII.
She is some ministrant dove of celestial orders,
Or dark-veiled, mist-winged sprite, flown from Hesperian borders 
And traced of poised cloud-drift and willowed, phantom waters!
Up, Heart, and hail her, dusk-ennobled Queen of Daughters! ",July,1916,The Crisis,W.E.B. Du Bois,Ode,male,"Racsim, Black Beauty, ",,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Song of the American Dove,Lucian Watkins,Watkins,"I build my nest not on the crest
Of the mountain-throne, but in the breast–
The sheltering arm of the forest warm,
Where my dovelets swing ‘mid the maddest storm;
Here I see and sigh! ‘neath the grieving sky, 
Lo, a race is hung on the trees!
A-wing I go, and the land below 
Is riot-red with a cruel woe;
For the hand of Hate, at a furious rate,
Is sowing the seeds of a terrible fate;
And each venomous seed is the prejudice weed
That buds and blooms with a murderous deed!
Oh, I love the land of Justice grand, 
Where men are free, heart, head and hand;
Where the smile and nod of the greening sod
Are bright and and glad with the gift of God:
Where over the plains and the mountainous reigns
The flag that frees each soul from chains!
“Land of the free,” whose flag I see!
What boots thy boast of Liberty? 
 What avails thy might, while in thy sight
A race is robbed of its dearest right?
Hark! I hear the yell of the hounds of hell–
Thy sons obsessed with the lynching spell!
How I long to see thy Liberty
With e’en thy lowliest subject free;
With none denied or crushed in pride,
But souls ascending side by side;
Thy streaming Stars and bleeding Bars
Thus mean a victory more than war’s!
“Let freedom ring”- ‘tis a well to sing, 
But let it from the mountains bring–
Not only to the fortunate few–
Its peace to all ‘neath the “Red, White and Blue!”

Mammy,Otto Bohanan,Bohanan,"She held him in her bronzen arms
   And fed him from her lavish breast,
And rid him of a child's alarms,
   With songs that gave him rest.

He loved her tenderly, he said,
   And vowed to fill her life with pleasure.
He's growing old and she is dead,
   A picture in his memory's treasure.

But once he paused upon the bench
   Ere yet he spake the final sentence
Upon a slender black-faced wench,
   Whose eyes were grime with unrepentance:

""Old Mammy's child! Tut! Tut! 'Tis bad
   For one so young to mock the law.
Your mother's eyes must deepen sad,
   She looked upon these things with awe.""

To the Dunbar High School ,Angelina W. Grimke,Grimke,"And she shall be the friend of youth for aye;
Of quick'ning youth whose eyes have seen the gleam;
Of youth between whose tears and laughter stream
Bright bows of hope; of youth, audacious, gay

A Shakespeare or a Galahad. The dream
To him is real: and things are as they seem,
For Beauty veils from him the feet of clay.

How holy and how wonderful her trust--
Youth's friend--and yes, how blest. For down the west
Each day shall go to the sun, and time in time
Shall die, the unborn shall again be dust;
But she with youth eternal on her breast,
Immortal, too, shall sit serene, sublime.

No less do I drink to her beauty and youth,
Than to her meek innocence, virtue and truth;
And meekly arrayed in thy modest brocade,
I drink to thy health, Ethiopian maid.

Thy vision creeps in the enchantments of dreams;
The pipings of skylarks and trills of the wren
Are mixed in the midst of the melody when
Thy laughter rings out in the vine scented glade,
As I drink to thy health, Ethiopian maid.
When sun of the tropics turns westward and dies,
The magic still lingers in light of thine eyes;
I mingle my goblet with oil of the palm,
Where spices hang over and summer smiles warm,
And there, 'mid the magic of forest and shade,
I drink thy sweet health, Ethiopian maid.

The blessed boon of liberty.

The spirit is at last unyoked
To seek her heaven, as she ought,
On sturdy wings of fearless thought.
Then come the dreams which through the day
The moil of living shuts away .
Then can the soul her fountains fill,
While all the universe is still,
From streams of quietness that rise
Out of the hills of Paradise.

And I can tell the day was meant
For some design beneficent,
For sweet-imagined sounds I hear,
And forms of beauty hover near

Walk unafraid within that Living Hell, 
Nor heed the driving rain of shot and shell

Against man's wrong to man- for such full well

" ""War Profiles"" ",Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"I

THE breath of the harvest is in the air. The boys of Ethiopia, khaki clad, are bidding farewell to the city of their love. They are swinging the corner to the tune of 

""John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, 
But his soul goes marching on.""

We men and women of Ethiopia are waving handkerchiefs and moistening our cheeks with tear drops. It is farewell time for our young life. 

How many of these that walk so proudly behind the flag of Appomattox will the warm earth of France receive? How many will be dust to keep alive the lilies? 

Ethiopia is paying her debt to the nation that gave the world Dumas. 

II

Toussaint, old man of the mountains, is tramping the streets of Port au Prince.

""Whither do you go, Graybeard?"" challenges the sentry. 

Toussaint's voice is soft and low.

""I go to arouse the sleeping men of Ethiopia. 

""This is the hour that tries the nations and the races. 

""War is a young man's glory, an old man's remembrance.

""France is bowed in desolation. To her I dedicate the young men of my blood that she might be saved from the claw of the vulture.

How desolate is State Street, now that war has come upon the land!

How desolate the Cabaret. Who can be gay now that the young are about to die? The pavement of a street that once held rendezvous with music is wet with tears of those who have given loved ones to the cause. 

No longer walk the merchant, lawyer, doctor, thief and toiler along the lighted path of this merry thoroughfare. The khaki makes all men one. 

Old men are peddling dreams of a new Ethiopia; old women and young women long for the laughter of State Street grown sober.

No longer the young men bombard its walls the laughter of youth. 

The young girls, brown as the autumn landscape or yellow as the noonday glow, pass by, lonely and dejected. 

How many Novembers, how many Decembers will die before laughter again runs riot?

God turned to him who sits on His right hand and said: 

""What is this, like the wailing of music, that reaches my throne? 

""'Tis the children of the oppressed crying for succor, I have heard their prayer night and day. 

""Ethiopia is in pain, Israel is bleeding, Poland is no more, India is weary of the strange gods that infest her groves. The tomb of my Son is desecrated and Jerusalem is the dwelling place of Gentiles.

Morning Light,Effie Lee Newsome (Mary Effie Lee),Newsome,"(The Dew-drier)

It is a custom in some parts of Africa for travelers into the jungles to send before them in the early morning little African boys called “Dew-driers” to brush with their bodies the dew from the high grasses—and be, perchance, the first to meet the leopard’s or hyena’s challenge—and so open the road. “Human Brooms,” Dan Crawford calls them.

Brother to the firefly—
For as the firefly lights the night
So lights he the morning—
Bathed in the dank dews as he goes forth
Through heavy menace and mystery
Of half-waking tropic dawns,
Behold a little black boy, a naked black boy,
Sweeping aside with his slight frame
Night’s pregnant tears,
And making a morning path to the light
For the tropic traveler!

Bathed in the blood of battle,
Treading toward a new morning,
May not his race—its body long bared to the world’s disdain,
Its face schooled to smile for a light to come—
May not his race, even as the dew-boy leads,
Bear onward the world toward a new day-dawn
When tolerance, forgiveness,

Ballade to Paul Laurence Dunbar,Lucian Watkins,Watkins,"We would not call you, Dunbar, from your rest,
For you were weary when you sotfly sang
The lullaby that soothed your love-sweet breast,
And o'er the raptured world divinely rang,
Amid the storms of Life's tumultuous clan,
Of battle-thunders in the fateful Night
That hide the smiles of Heaven from our sight;--
Lo, while you sleep the sleep of paradise
We seek the blessed morning and its light
'Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes!'

ENVOY

Ah, Poet Paul! you ang and all is right!
We feel our soulds expanding for the flight--
Lord, help us breathe to Thee a prayer and rise
And touch Thy Truth Eternal on the Height.
'Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes!'

The Black Madonna And Her Babe,Lucian Watkins,Watkins,"She cradles him, her babe, upon her breast,
Great with this joy of all the earth most dear.
A lullaby, touched with a trembling tear.
She croons to Heaven; it is a prayer exprest
that he, her boy, may triumph in life's test.
He sleeps in dreamless peace, his listless ear
Close to her gentle heart of love sincere--
The strength that is her soul's immortal best. 
Madonna! many a son you offer up
On Truth's eternal Cross of Calvary;
And you have drunk of each's death brimming cup.
Down in the vale of God's Gethsemane.
Dear Lord! this woman and her children sup
The gall of death--for Boundless Liberty.

Star of Ethiopia,Lucian Watkins,Watkins,"Out in the night thou art the sun
Toward which thy soul-charmed children run,
The faith-high height whereon they see
The glory of their Day To Be,--
The peace at last when all is done. 

The Night is dark but, one by one,
Thy signals, ever and anon,
Smile beacon answers to their plea,
Out in the Night.

Ah, Life! thy storms these cannot shun;
Give them a hope to rest upon,
A Dream to dream eternally.
The strength of men who would be free
And win the battle-race begun,
Out in the Night.

"Go, Give the World",Otto Bohanan,Bohanan,"I do not crave to have thee mine alone, dear,
Keeping thy chamrs within my jealous sight;
Go, give the world the blessing of thy beauty,
That other hearts may share of my delight!

I do not ask, thy love should be mine only
While others falter through the dreary night;
Go, kiss the tears from some wayfarer's vision,
That other eyes may know the joy of light!

Where days are sad and skies are hung with darkness,
Go, send a smile that sunshine may be rife;
Go, give a song, a word of kindly greeting,
To ease the sorry of some lonely life!

The Brave Son,Alston Burleigh,Burleigh,"A little boy, lost in his childish play,
Mid the deep'ning shades of the fading day,
Fancied the warrior he would be;
He scattered his foes with his wooden sword
And put to fight a mighty horde--
Ere he crept to his daddy's knee.
A soldier crawled o'er the death-stren plain,
And he uttered the name of his love, in vain,
As he stumbled over the crest;
He fought with the fierceness of dark despair
And drove the cowering for to his lair--
Ere he crept to his Father's breast.

The thing for which he strives. For he 
Who rests, and there supinely waits
For some chance guerdon of reward,
But waits in vain.
Be strong! Be strong!
Have faith, my son!

Not feel that God is on His throne,
Nor know that all thy life is but
A prelude to a larger growth,
Thy strength were vain.

To Bishop Hood  ,Joseph S. Cotter,Cotter,"Pure speech, sure speech, speech that always blends
With the rugged mettle of a foe's or friend's,
Is thine, good preacher, thine.

Fair ways, rare ways, ways that lead us on 
To the fuller morning from a meager dawn,
Are thine, wise preacher, thine. 

New thought, true thought, thought that points the way
Through doubt's mists and shadows to good
God's man-wrought day,
Is thine, brave preacher, thine. 

Old faith, bold faith, faith whose anchors still
Grapple in the fastness of the sane man's will,
Is thine, firm preacher, thine. 

Far dreams, star dreams, dreams that hedge us in
From the rocks of passion and the shoals of sin,
Are thine, great preacher, thine.

Sonnet,Alice Dunbar-Nelson,Dunbar-Nelson,"I had not thought of violets of late,
The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet
In wistful April days, when lovers mate
And wander through the fields in rapturous sweet,
The thought of violets meant florists’ shops,
And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine;
And garish lights, and mincing little fops,
And cabarets and songs, and deadenign wine.
So far from the sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,
I had forgot wide fields, and clear brown streams; 
The perfect loveliness that God has made,--
Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams.

Of violets and my soul’s forgotten gleam.",August,1919,The Crisis,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset",Sonnet,female,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Dunbar_Nelson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ONE unto him does heaven grant to bend
By day and night above the creamy cheek
And dimpled smile of baby. 'Tis the meek,
Sweet privilege of mother to attend
The cradle shrine. There patience without end
Wins her a beauty words can never speak.
Her troubled joy has nothing more to seek
Where life and love in one devotion blend.

For him the roughened world, all day for him
The tyrant task, the tension of the mind.

Were not that hour to come when twilight dim

Negro Dancers,Claude McKay,McKay,"I
Lit with cheap colored lights a basement den,
With rows of chairs and tables on each side,
And, all about, young, dark-skinned women and men
Drinking and smoking, merry, vacant-eyed.
A Negro band, that scarcely seems awake,
Drones out half-heartedly a lazy tune,
While quick and willing boys their orders take
And hurry to and from the near saloon.
Then suddenly a happy, lilting note
Is struck, the walk and hop and trot begin,
Under the smoke upon foul air afloat;
Around the room the laughing puppets spin
To sound of fiddle, drum and clarinet,
Dancing, their world of shadows to forget.
II
’Tis best to sit and gaze; my heart then dances
To the lithe bodies gliding slowly by,
The amorous and inimitable glances
That subtly pass from roguish eye to eye,
The laughter gay like sounding silver ringing,
That fills the whole wide room from floor to ceiling,—
A rush of rapture to my tried soul bringing—
The deathless spirit of a race revealing.
Not one false step, no note that rings not true!
Unconscious even of the higher worth
Of their great art, they serpent-wise glide through
The syncopated waltz. Dead to the earth
And her unkindly ways of toil and strife,
For them the dance is the true joy of life.
III
And yet they are the outcasts of the earth,
A race oppressed and scorned by ruling man;
How can they thus consent to joy and mirth
Who live beneath a world-eternal ban?
No faith is theirs, no shining ray of hope,
Except the martyr’s faith, the hope that death
Some day will free them from their narrow scope
And once more merge them with the infinite breath.
But, oh! they dance with poetry in their eyes
Whose dreamy loveliness no sorrow dims,
And parted lips and eager, gleeful cries,
And perfect rhythm in their nimble limbs.
The gifts divine are theirs, music and laughter;
All other things, however great, come after.",July,1919,The Liberator,Max Eastman,Sonnet,male,"Dance, Music, Harlem, Racism",The New Negro,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mad oaths of iron heals, breath after breath,--
Hate thunder and its lightning doom of death

Slow-dying mothers moan and children wail!

But from the fields of righteous blood and tears,
Where fought and fell mall millions, maimed and dead,
Peace rose and reigned a thousand, thousand years.

To search out undiscovered mystery,
Undreamed of in our poor philosophy!

Of clay; but poised, empowered to command,
Upon the Etna of New Worlds we'll stand--

Full richly robed as supermen at last!

The Prophet,Joseph S. Cotter,Cotter,"He saw Life masquerade in Babylon,
He saw Life jaded by the mystic Nile,
While weaving tapestry of brick and sone
To mesh its merriment and seal its smile.
He brought the fore-time to this after-time,
He questioned workers, warriors, poets, sages.
Then whispered to himself: 'Nor tribe, nor clime,
Nor God, nor Devil can unwed the ages.'

The Prophet felt the ache that we are feeling,
The Prophet saw the greed that bows us under;
And heard the echo of our tense appealing
For brotherhood that dares not halt nor blunder.
The Past will be the Present. Let us make
To-day to-morrow for our children's sake.

Oriflamme,Jessie Fauset,Fauset,"I can remember when I was a little, young girl, how my old mammy would sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and groan, and I would say, ‘Mammy, what makes you groan so?’ And she would say, ‘I am groaning to think  of my poor children; they do not know where I be and I don’t know where they be. I look up at the stars and they look up at the stars!’ —Sojourner Truth

I think I see her sitting, bowed and black,
Stricken and seared with slavery’s mortal scars,
Reft of her children, lonely, anguished, yet
Still looking at the stars.

Pounding our stubborn hearts on Freedom’s bars,
Clutching our birthright, fight with faces set,

Are fallen, vanquished in the fray,
Their glory mingled with the dust,
Their archives stained with crime and lust;
And all that breathed of pomp and pride,
Like the untimely fig, has died.
On thing, alone, restrains, exalts
A nation and corrects its faults;
One thin, alone, its life can crown
And give its destiny renown.
That nation, then, is truly great,
That lives by love, and not by hate;
That bends beneath the chastening rod,
That owns the truth, and looks to God!

It's Great To Be A Problem,John Wesley Work (J.W. Work),Work,"It’s great to be a problem,
A problem just like me;
To have the world inquiring
And asking what you be.

You can’t be that,

So different from all other men,
The world is studying you.

The rocky road must go.

Where we would go,
What we would be about.

I’m insolent if I speak;
Must curb my aspirations,
I must be lowly, meek.

The Pool,Amedee Brun,Brun,"Translated by Jessie Fauset 
The lonely pool sleeps in the depth of the glade
At the foot of a slope which its beauty discloses;
And the whispering reeds make a rustling retreat
Which the stream lips or leaves as it wakes or reposes. 

The heather erects a dense rampart of green
To conceal the sweet tide which reflects in its deeps
The tops of tall trees, and this one labor done, 

Forgetting aught else, dreams and placidly sleeps. 
Now and then comes a bird—a blackcap or a swallow,
Which with its swift flight makes the mute, formless hollow
Of solitude ring with a shrill, plaintive sound. 

Its wings barely skim the pool drowsy with slumber,
Yet small, eager waves circling wide, without number,
Haste to die 'mid the pitying reeds grouped around.

Bound for three-hundred years.
His voice resounded through the land
‘Til millions sent up cheers.
 
He led his race out from the tomb
Of darkness and despair.
That crushed hopes might revive and bloom
In liberty’s pure air.
 
He did not heed the cynic’s sneer--
His soul fell in a dream.
And critics could not hush the lips
That spoke of freedom’s theme.
 
He saw his mother country free--
Behold her rising star.
And begged his countrymen to flee
Where kin and loved ones are.
 
Inspired by God, one hundred years
Became to him a day:
He saw his kinsmen, heard their cry
When future tyrants sway.
 
He saw them swept like driven tide
To Canada’s retreat,
Confined there by the ocean bars,
And trampled under feet.
 
He saw his people pass away
Like clouds that tempests rend.
While idlers criticised and smiled,
He was the black man’s friend.
 
Fired with a patriotic zeal
That fanned his loving heart.
He yearned his native land ties
That aliens tore apart.
 
He saw a flag eyes could not see--
A nation yet unborn--
A land where black men might be free,
The dawn of freedom’s morn.
 
He did not deem the price too dear
(Whatever it might be)
For black men to regain their soil
And set their country free.

To where non but Apollo's darlings rise.

And tells him stories.

Working in the hot sun,
And black slaves
Walking in the dewy night,
And black slaves
Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
Mingle themselves softly
In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,
Mingle themselves softly
In the dark shadows that cross and recross
Aunt Sue's stories.

And the dark-faced child, listening,
Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.
He knows that Aunt Sue
Never got her stories out of any book at all,
But that they came
Right out of her own life.

And the dark-faced child is quiet
Of a summer night
Listening to Aunt Sue's stories.

Remembering how your love has glorified

In Freedom's holy name-- to live or die.
Which seemeth best, for justice and for right!
Grant thou, O God, that through this sacrifice,
When blood has well atoned for ancient wrong,
That Ethiopia's Sons may raise their heads
And sing a louder, clearer, grander song.'

When hushed is every bitter cry of woe,
That all your children who to earth are spared,
In bonds of fellowship may firmer grow.

Like white moths trembling on the tropic air,
Or waters of the hills that softly flow
Gracefully falling down a shining stair.

And when the fields and streets are covered white
And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw,
Or underneath a spell of heat and light
The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,

Like me you’ll long for home, where birds’ glad song
Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry,
And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong,
Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.

Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead
Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain,
Went sorrowing with it across the plain.

Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone,
Detained a fragile shadow. Golden-lipped

With scarlet roses tinting her green breast,
And mating thrushes ushering in her day,
And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest,

I always see the evening when we met─
The first of June baptized in tender rain─
And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet,
Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love’s pain.

I always see the cheerful little room,
And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed,
Sweet scented with a delicate perfume,
Wherein for one night only we were wed;

Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute,
And heard the whispering showers all night long,
And your brown burning body was a lute
Whereon my passion played his fevered song.

When June comes dancing o’er the death of May,
With scarlet roses staining her fair feet,
My soul takes leave of me to sing all day
A love so fugitive and so complete.

Leaving behind the vestige of a tear.

Without the street is wet and weird with snow;
The cold nude trees are tossing to and fro;

From Afric's Sunny Shore,O.M. Skinner,Skinner,"From Afric's sunny country

Their land from error's chain

And man alone is vile
In hope we raise our voices
To Thee the God above--
O show us some devices 
With which to show our love.
We shall not rest in silence
We shall not hold our peace
 Until the accursed violence
Upon they people cease.
O give us faith to conquer
O give us strength to fight
Until shall cease our languor 
That men shall see the light.
And then shall waft the story 
O'er mountain, hill and plain,
To God belongs the glory
Christ has not died in vain.

Shall know the God of might
Shall seek His free salvation

We ask Thee to draw You near.

Who can’st revenge but Thou?
And still Thy people is dying,

Dad,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"His ways are circumspect and bound
With trite simplicities;
His is the grace of comforts found
In homely hearthside ease.
His words are sage and fall with care,
Because he loves me so;
And being his, he knows, I fear,
The dizzy path I go.
For he was once as young as I,
As prone to take the trail,
To find delight in the sea’s low cry,
And a lone wind’s lonely wail.
It is his eyes that tell me most
How full his life has been;
There lingers there the faintest ghost
Of some still sacred sin.
So I must quaff Life’s crazy wine,
And taste the gall and dregs;
And I must spend this wealth of mine,
Of vagrant wistful legs;
And I must follow, follow, follow
The lure of a silver horn,
That echoes from a leafy hollow,
Where the dreams of youth are born.
Then when the star has shed its gleam,
The rose its crimson coat;
When Beauty flees the hidden dream,
And Pan’s pipes blow no note;
When both my shoes are worn too thin,
My weight of fire to bear,
I’ll turn like dad, and like him win
The peace of a snug arm-chair.

   Black as the night is black,
   Black like the depths of my Africa.

I've been a slave:
   Caesar told me to keep his door-steps clean .

I've been a worker:
   Under my hand the pyramids arose.
   I made mortar for the Woolworth Building.

I've been a singer:
   All the way from Africa to Georgia
   I carried my sorrow songs.
   I made ragtime.

Beneath a warming, stirring sun,
Beneath a flower-studded sod

A kindly couch where dreams the brave,
Where longing hurries weeping grief,
where halting goes the gilded chief.

Grim frost shall lose his howl and wail,
And summer flowers deck my breast 
And sunlight gild me from the west.
But I shall rise with verdant spring,
And I shall speak when song-birds sing, 
And laughing ripple in the streams,
And flit and flicker on the beams.

In blood of tyrants, who debarred the way
To Freedom's dawning. Hearken to the lay

The royal emblems, leaving not a trace;
And time still burgeoneth the fertile seed
Though he is crucified who wrought the deed:

And Christian Rule —so called—
Lynching still holds sway!

Oh, ye ! whose blood has . . .
Not turned yellow, but —
Still runs crimson, as in
Mother's sacred womb,
Can ye, with inborn conscience
Give ""unwritten"" Lynch Law— room?

I dare say: ""No!""
No self-respecting mortal
Who loves humanity and
Submits to white man's ""written"" laws.
Condones such jackal, cut-throat practice,
That chokes great Lincoln's aim with . . .
""Hyena Claws!""

Yet, notwithstanding all,
Our black boys fought like heroes
To save this white man's country
From an unknown foreign foe.
Their noble deeds were heralded by allies
In France, in Belgium and in England too.

The beaten foe himself,
Feels conscience-bound to honor
The black man's valor and his daring deeds ;
But Southland . . . Home !—with Houston —
   Texas leading.
Insults parading heroes on return; Oh, Shame!

What then? Some heart-sick boys resented
The unjust treatment meted out to them.
When quickly organized a rabble, ready
For record-breaking savage cruelty,
And hanged the boys that risked their lives for them.

Freed and gone before their Master,
Pleading Justice, Justice only!
For their people, who, though black
Gave their loved ones to the country;

I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.

They squint an eye at aims sublime,
In blowing bubbles they have push.
A trifle grinds away their time;
They breathe an artificial wish;
I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.

Their mode of life is like the bears'—
Blind to the energy of truth.
Their thumbs are down on him who cares;
They hurt him like an aching tooth.

To a Scientist,Thomas Millard Henry,Henry,"I saw the sunset yesterday
Behind the gold and purple west.
My soul's a richer soul for aye,
Because upon my heart was pressed
Its dream-inspiring souvenir.
Last June when roses were in bloom,
I saw one rare one in the dew.
My heart beats faster, I presume,
Because it was so simply new —
So supra-sweet its atmosphere.
I hear men praying to behold
Some far-off glory, and to share
Some city built of finest gold;
But why should I have business there,
If it be lovelier than here?
If I'm too crude to entertain
The joy that's made for me on earth.
Would not you think me basely vain
To build a bridge across its worth
In search of something lovelier?
And I can count them by the score, —
Those beauties that have touched my life.
The souls untouched by them are poor;
And they will help you in the strife
Who are our civic pioneer.",October,1923,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Voyaging,Leslie Pinckney Hill,Hill,"However hard the winds may blow,
However strong the tides may flow,
Though lightning flash and thunders peal,
We trust the Master at the wheel.
Driven by storms to veer and tack,
He never turns the good ship back,
But rights her heel, and evermore
Fares forward to the distant shore.
Poor children of the human race,
Far voyaging through time and space,
How hard beset, how driven wide
On angry seas by wind and tide!
But high above the streaming years
The faithful lodestar Truth appears,
And thitherwards through tempests still
Trembles the compass of Good-will.
Faith in the Master, and mankind
Some day beyond the flood will find,
When dark and wind and peril cease,
The shining harbor shores of Peace. ",April,1923,Opportunity,Charles S. Johnson,Quatrain,male,Travel,,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/leslie-pinckney-hill-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding earth-plains fair plains, save greenly grassed,
They strewed white feathers of cowardice, as they passed;

                 The hills all red and darkened pine,
They blanched with their wand of power;
And turned the blood in a ruby rose
To a poor white poppy-flower.

They pyred a race of black, black men, 
And burned them to ashes white; then
Laughing, a young one claimed a skull.
For the skull of a black is white, not dull,

In the face of God with all his might,

And scheme and calculate with such shrewd wit,

Men court not death
When there are sweets still left in life to taste.
Nor will a brave man choose to live when he,
Full deeply drunk of life, has reached the dregs,
And knows that now but bitterness remains.

Rain Fugue,Jessie Fauset,Fauset,"Slanting, driving, Summer rain
How you wash my heart of pain!
How you make me think of trees,
Ships and gulls and flashing seas!
In your furious, tearing wind,
Swells a chant that heals my mind;
And your passion high and proud,
Makes me shout and laugh aloud!

Autumn rains that start at dawn,
‘Dropping veils of thinnest lawn’;
Soaking sod between dank grasses,
Sweeping golden leaves in masses,-
Blotting, blurring out the Past,
In a dream you hold me fast;
Calling, coaxing to forget
Thing that are, for things not yet.

Winter tempest, winter rain,
Hurtling down with might and main,
You but make me hug my heart,
Laughing, sheltered from your wrath.
Now I woo my dancing fire,
Piling, piling drift-wood higher.
Books and friends and pictures old,
Hearten while you pound and scold!

Pattering wistful showers of Spring
Set me to remembering
Far-off times and lovers too,
Gentle joys and heart-break rue,-
Memories I’d as lief forget,
Were not oblivion sadder yet.
Ah! you twist my mind with pain,
Wistful whispering April rain!

Summer, Autumn, Winter rain,
How you ease my heart of pain!
Whispering, wistful showers of Spring,
How I love the hurt you bring!

Here's April,Jessie Fauset,Fauset,"This town that yesterday was dark and mean,
   And dank and raw with Winter's freezing air,
Is Light itself today, and verdant Sheen
   Gold-tinted, and besprent with perfume rare;
Translated over night to a parterre
   That makes me dream of Araby and Spain,
And all the healing places of the Earth,
   Where one lays by his woe, his bitter pain,
      For peace and mirth.

II

Old Winter that stayed by us black and drear,
   And laid his blighting seal on everything,
Is vanished.-—Is it true he once was here?--
   Mark how the ash-trees bud, and children sing,
And birds set up a faint, shy jargoning;
   And healing balm pours out from bole and leaf.
For Spring—sweet April's here in tree and grass!
   Oh foolish heart to fret so with your grief!
      This too shall pass!

Child of the Night,Walter Everett Hawkins,Hawkins,"Child of the Night am I-
Night's sable son;
When the elf-children came,
   Lo! I was one.

Darkness was over me when I was born,
I court the night-spirits and scoff at the morn,
Rainbows of midnight my features adorn.
   At the great forge of Time,
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
   Ere light was born.

   Poised on the wings of Night,
      Upward I glide,
   Flouting the flings of light,
      Proudly I ride.

I rest on the pillows of thunderous clouds,
Arrayed in the billows of wondrous shrouds,
I whip up the lightnings and mock the pale crowds.

   At the great forge of Time,
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
      Ere light was born.
   Blessing the sable sons,
      Lifting their shroud,
   Pressing less able ones,
      Purging the proud.

I daub them with ebony, smother their pride,
I swab them with smoke and their vanity chide.
Is the soul of a man in the hue of his hide?

   At the great forge of Time
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
      Ere light was born.
   Child of the dusky veil,
      Kissed by the Sun,
   Girded in trusty mail,
      Truth bids me on.

Cloud me in battle smoke, night-shrouds attend me,
The beginning was blackness and so will the end be;
Black God and black angels, surround and defend me!

   At the great forge of Time,
   Making men's souls sublime,
   I stood arrayed in Night
      Ere light was born.

Alas,Thomas Millard Henry,Henry,"My loftier songs may never see the light,
Though fine as what some pompous bard can make.

Incurred by eating peanuts yesternight.
But luck can't hide the sparks, for sparks are bright
And should, because of darkness, win the cake,
(As Dunbar showed you in his glittering wake)
So fame again might treat song's victim white.
No Muses can rebel stomach rule;
She'll force them to the bread and cabbage class;
Thin walls divide the martyr and the fool,
And death is less inviting than the crass ;

And bends to prose, your steed with wings outflung,
Veils the Plebeian quills ;—wreath-hemmed while young
As Byron was, or Dunbar, at nineteen.
Your diapasons fill Apollo's skies;
Yet, when his restless Nine encircle you,
For pennyroyal sinks your hooked line,
You tonic us mid pleasure and surprise . . .
So I one of your patients credit you
For songs like meat, like medicine, like wine.",October,1924,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",Sonnet,male,Intertext,,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Poems,Thomas Millard Henry,Henry,"The Song of Psyche

'Twas divined from the notes of a lark

Dreams Are the Workman's Friends

Dreams are the workman's friends. Their rapture can
Awake his spirits better than old wines ;
To 'waken him to beauty is their plan;
They bring him rubies from remote confines.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

I daily hang my latchstrings out of doors
For them. They throw conditions to the winds.
They find me lighting lamps or tinting floors;
And yet they greet me like old-fashioned friends.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

Forsooth, the elves of limbo leave my camp,
They jostle in confusion in retreat.
My rapture drives them onward like a lamp
Drives on the dark before the pilgrim's feet.
   Dreams are the workman's friends.

They bring me mingled rapture o'er the crest,
That once behind horizons hid away.
Their gift of rapture burns within my breast
Like twilight beams that love the dying day.
   Dreams are the workman's friends. 

My Motive

Should you who listen to my flute
Conclude 'twere best if I were mute,
Or should you doubt that I have won
The wreath of praise, the glad ""well done"";
If you some better verse have read,
My soul would still be comforted :—
For though I limitations feel.
Love, strangling judgment, made me kneel, —
Constrained by reverence, not conceit —
To vent my soul at Beauty's feet.",January,1924,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,male,Labor,,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will be men and no man's tool!

Justice alone is our demand,
The right to use our brain and hand,
The right to be our soul's possessor!

These mean streets and huddled houses of night
Into something touched with holiness?

Soothed the maimed bodies and weary hearts

An easy breeze at blossom time.

Every land and dream

To whirl in tall buildings,

The Memory of Colonel Charles Denton Young,Harriette Shadow Butcher,Butcher,"With satin skin and body bare, they beat the air with drum;
They sang a weird, uncanny song that seemed to strike them numb;
Full passionate their bodies beat to time not elsewhere heard—
A melody of wind and rain and gentle song of bird.

   When hawk and eagle fly by night,
   There shines on each the same moon’s light.

With satin skin and body bare they danced to sun and star,
They stalked the mighty game to lair, and drew men near and far;
With milky skin and body decked a people came to see
What made the satin bare-skinned men so happy and so free.

   When hawk and eagle search by day,
   They seek, forsooth, the self-same prey.

The simple truth they failed to see, it lay before their eyes:
The men with satin skins were kings; they wore no motley dyes;
They reached their goal on sweeping wings—such wings as eagles fly.
The nightingale no longer sings when hawks go sailing by.

   O eagle, spread your wings tonight;
   Let not the hawk get out of sight.

The milky skins took bodies bare across the ocean wide;
They made them slaves to their command, their souls they could not guide.
All day the slaves worked in the sun, to till the soil their task,
They suffered all that humans could and wore a smiling mask.

   The eagle soars high in the air;
   It holds a place no hawk will dare.

With nothing they could call their own, no earthly prize to win,
Their hidden souls were theirs alone,—a holiness within;
They held their heads as eagles do and looked into the sky.
The hawks made circles in the air and with great pride flew by.

   O hawk, fold up your wings tonight.
   The eagle’s flown far from your sight.

Crusader, you of our own time, who proved to all the world
That red and blue and white are strong when in ene emblem furled;
Crusader, true, of our own time, who left a country fair,
You turned a Son to your own clime—a Son with kingly air.
For, radiant in your consciousness beneath your carriage bold,
There shone your heritage of strength—a gift that eagles hold.

White moon peeks; when lovers pledge their truth.

Heritage,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea, 
Jungle star or jungle track,
Strong bronzed men, or regal black
Women from whose loins I sprang
When the birds of Eden sang?
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who all day long
Want no sound except the song
Sung by wild barbaric birds
Goading massive jungle herds,
Juggernauts of flesh that pass
Trampling tall defiant grass
Where young forest lovers lie,
Plighting troth beneath the sky.
So I lie, who always hear,
Though I cram against my ear
Both my thumbs, and keep them there,
Great drums throbbing through the air.
So I lie, whose fount of pride,
Dear distress, and joy allied ,
Is my somber flesh and skin,
With the dark blood dammed within
Like great pulsing tides of wine
That, I fear, must burst the fine
Channels of the chafing net
Where they surge and foam and fret.
Africa? A book one thumbs
Listlessly, till slumber comes.
Unremembered are her bats
Circling through the night, her cats
Crouching in the river reeds,
Stalking gentle flesh that feeds
By the river brink ; no more
Does the bugle- throated roar
Cry that monarch claws have leapt
From the scabbards where they slept.
Silver snakes that once a year
Doff the lovely coats you wear,
Seek no covert in your fear
Lest a mortal eye should see;
What's your nakedness to me?
Here no leprous flowers rear
Fierce corollas in the air;
Here no bodies sleek and wet,
Dripping mingled rain and sweat,
Tread the savage measures of
Jungle boys and girls in love.
What is last year's snow to me,
Last year's anything? The tree
Budding yearly must forget
How its past arose or set--
Bough and blossom, flower, fruit,
Even what shy bird with mute
Wonder at her travail there,
Meekly labored in its hair.
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who find no peace
Night or day, no slight release
From the unremittant beat
Made by cruel padded feet
Walking through my body's street.
Up and down they go, and back,
Treading out a jungle track.
So I lie, who never quite
Safely sleep from rain at night
I can never rest at all
When the rain begins to fall;
Like a soul gone mad with pain
I must match its weird refrain;
Ever must I twist and squirm,
Writhing like a baited worm ,
While its primal measures drip
Through my body, crying, ""Strip!
Doff this new exuberance.
Come and dance the Lover's Dance!""
In an old remembered way
Rain works on me night and day.
Quaint, outlandish heathen gods
Black men fashion out of rods,
Clay, and brittle bits of stone,
In a likeness like their own,
My conversion came high-priced;
I belong to Jesus Christ,
Preacher of humility;
Heathen gods are naught to me.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
So I make an idle boast;
Jesus of the twice-turned cheek,
Lamb of God, although I speak
With my mouth thus, in my heart
Do I play a double part.
Ever at Thy glowing altar
sick and falter,
Wishing He I served were black,
Thinking then it would not lack
Precedent of pain to guide it,
Must my heart grow
Let who would or might deride it;
Surely then this flesh would know
Yours had borne a kindred woe.
Lord, I fashion dark gods, too,
Daring even to give You
Dark despairing features where,
Crowned with dark rebellious hair,
Patience wavers just so much as
Mortal grief compels, while touches
Quick and hot, of anger, rise
To smitten cheek and weary eyes.
Lord, forgive me if my need
Sometimes shapes a human creed.
All day long and all night through,
One thing only must I do:
Quench my pride and cool my blood,
Lest I perish in the flood.
Lest a hidden ember set
Timber that I thought was wet
Burning like the dryest flax,
Melting like the merest wax,
Lest the grave restore its dead.

In the least way realized

Threnody for a Brown Girl,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Weep not, you who love her --
What rebellious flow
Grief undams shall recover
Whom the gods bid go?
Sorrow rising like a wall,
Bitter, blasphemous --
What avails it to recall
Beauty back to us?

Think not this grave shall keep her,
This marriage-bed confine;
Death may dig it deep and deeper --
She shall climb it like a vine.
Body that was quick and sentient,
Dear as thought or speech,
Death could not, with one trenchant
Blow, snatch out of reach!

She is nearer than the word
Wasted on her now,
Nearer than the swaying bird
On its rhythmic bough.
Only were our faith as much
As a mustard seed,
Aching hungry hands might touch
Her as they touch a reed.

Life, who was not loth to trade
Her unto death, has done
Better than he planned, has made
Her wise as Solomon.
Now she knows the Why and Wherefore,
Troublous Whence and Whither;
Why men strive and sweat, and care for
Bays that droop and wither.

All the stars she knows by name,
End and origin thereof,
Knows if love be kin to shame,
If shame be less than love.
What was crooked now is straight,
What was rough is plain;
Grief and sorrow have no weight
Now to cause her pain.

One to her are flame and frost;
Silence is her singing lark.
We alone are children -- lost,
Crying in the dark.
Varied features now, and form
Change has bred upon her;
Crush no bug or nauseous worm
Lest you tread upon her.

Pluck no flower lest she scream;
Bruise no slender reed
Lest it prove more than it seem,
Lest she groan and bleed.
More than ever trust your brother,
Read him golden, pure --
It may be she finds no other
House so safe and sure.

Set no poet carving
Rhymes to make her laugh;
Only live hearts starving
Need an epitaph.
Lay upon her no white stone
From a foreign quarry;
Earth and sky, be these alone
Her obituary.

Swift as a startled fawn or swallow,
Silence all her sound,
She has fled; we cannot follow
Further than this mound.
We who take the beaten track,
Trying to appease
Hearts near breaking with their lack,
We need elegies.

Three Hundred Years Ago,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Three hundred years ago there was a land
   And two who moved
With one fair thought: meet hand in hand,
   And to be loved.
Then came a ship and strange, pale men
   Who gave me drink
That made me sleep; I woke -- and then -- 
   The broken link.
I am nost sure that you were moved
  At all, or wept;
For you were young and much beloved --
   Perhaps you slept.
But there was blood, and sweat, and hell,
   And tears for me,
Till one whose voice was like a bell
   Said, 'Go, be free!'
The chains were off, but other things
   Still held me slave:
A stretch of land where gray sand clings
   To a warm white wave.
But more than this, there was yoru face,
   Beautiful and wise--
Oh, I have sought them every place,
   Your face and eyes.
Three hundred years ago, and yet 
   A day ago;
There still the red suns flare and set,
   The dark winds blow.

Lament,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"Now let all lovely things embark
Upon the sea of mist
With her whose luscious mouth the dark,
Grim troubadour has kissed.

The silver clock that ticked away
Her days, and never knew
Its beats were sword thrusts to the clay
That too much beauty slew.

The pillow favored with her tears
And hallowed by her head;
I shall not even keep my fears,
Now their concern is dead.

But where shall I bury sun and rain,
How mortalise the stars,
How still the half-heard cries of pain
That seared her soul with scars?

In what sea depths shall all the seeds
Of every flower die?
Where shall I scatter the broken reeds,
And how erase the sky?

And where shall I find a hole so deep
No troubled ghost may rise?
There will I put my heart to sleep
Wanting her face and eyes.

Night Rain,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"I wake to the sound of a soft, low patter
That comes like sudden news,
Or like the slow, uncadenced clatter
Of well-filled wooden shoes.
I know I have not waked for long,
That I shall dream again,
that God has sent a slumber song
Of dew and drowsy rain.
I hear it rush the willows through,
And strike the garden gate;
Far off a love bird's plaintive coo
Is answered of its mate.
The night rain works a subtle charm
Day showers never know;
It make me burrow deep and warm
Beneath my sheets of snow.
It brims the pansy's eager cup,
It dives to the oak's dank roots,
Inquisitive, meanders up,
And climbs the newest shoots.
It drips a melancholy tune,
As plunging fierce and deep,
It scurries wild across the moon
To steep my eyes in sleep. ",February ,1925,The Crisis,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset",Quatrain,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deluged my soul with song; if it were meet
To love Life so, then Love will but complete
My joy, for Live with Love can never end.
Love, I have heard the sweet of your voice, have seen 
You pass the dawn-flushed singing hills between;
Now suppliant I kneel and pray you show

If Love be Staunch,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"If love be staunch, call mountains brittle;
Love is a thing will live
So long, my dear,—oh, just the little
While water stays in a sieve.

Yea, love is deathless as the day
Whose death the stars reveal;
And love is loyal all the way,
If treachery be leal.

Beyond the shadow of a doubt,
No thing is sweet as love,
But, oh, the bitterness spewed out
Of the heart at the end thereof!

Beyond all cavil or complaint,
Love’s ways are double-dyed;
Beneath the surplice of a saint
The cloven hooves are spied.
Whom yesterday love rhymed his sun
Today he names a star;
When the course of another day is run,
What will he say you are?

Solace,Clarissa Scott Delany,Delany,"My window opens out into the trees
And in that small space
Of branches and of sky
I see the seasons pass
Behold the tender green
Give way to darker heavier leaves.
The glory of the autumn comes
When steeped in mellow sunlight
The fragile, golden leaves
Against a clear blue sky
Linger in the magic of the afternoon
And then reluctantly break off
And filter down to pave
A street with gold.
Then bare, gray branches
Lift themselves against the
Cold December sky
Sometimes weaving a web
Across the rose and dusk of late sunset
Sometimes against a frail new moon
And one bright star riding
A sky of that dark, living blue
Which comes before the heaviness
Of night descends, or the stars
Have powdered the heavens.
Winds beat against these trees;
The cold, but gentle rain of spring
Touches them lightly
The summer torrents strive
To lash them into a fury
And seek to break them-
But they stand.
My life is fevered
And a restlessness at times
An agony—again a vague
And baffling discontent
Possesses me.
I am thankful for my bit of sky
And trees, and for the shifting

A quiet.

To All of You

My little stone
Sinks quickly Into the bosom of this deep, dark pool
Of oblivion...
I have troubled its breast but little.
Yet those far shores
That knew me not
Will feel the fleeting, furtive kiss
Of my tiny concentric ripples.... 

To Lewellyn

You have borne full well
The burden of my friendship—
I have drunk deep
At your crystal pool,
And in return
I have-polluted its waters
With the bile of my hatred,
I have flooded your soul
With tortuous thoughts,
I have played Iscariot
To your Pythias... 

To Mother 

I came In the blinding sweep
Of ecstatic pain,
I go In the throbbing pulse
Of Aching Space,
In the eons between
I piled upon you
Pain on pain
Ache on ache
And yet as I go
I shall know
That you will grieve
And want me back..... 

To Bennetti 

You have freed me—
In opening wide the doors
Of fiesh—
You have freed me
Of the binding leash.
I have climbed the heights
Of white disaster.
My body screaming
In the silver crash of passion.....
Before you gave yourself
To him
I had chained myself
For you.
But when at last
You lowered your proud flag
In surrender complete
You gave me too, as hostage—
And I have swept my joy
At the dawn-tipped shrine
Of many breasts. 

To Jean

When you poured your love
Like molten flame
Into the throbbing mold
Of her pulsing veins
Leaving her blood a river of fire
And her arteries channels of light,
I hated you... 
Hated with that primal hate
That has its wells
In the flesh of me
And the flesh of you
And the flesh of her
I hated you—
Hated with envy
Your mastery of her being. .
With one fleshy gesture
You pricked the irridescent bubble
Of my dreams
And so to make
Your conquest more sweet
I tell you now
That I hated you...

To Catalina

Love thy piano,Oh girl,
It will give you back
Note for Note
The harmonies of your soul.

Oh Achilles of the moleskins
And the gridiron
Do not wonder
Nor doubt that this is I
That lie so calmly here—
This is the same exultant beast
That so joyously
Ran the ball with you
In those far flung days of abandon.
You remember how récklessly
We revelled in the heat and the dust
And the swirl of conflict?
You remember they called us
The Terrible Two?
And you remember
After we had battered our heads
And our bodies
Against the stonewall of their defense,—
You remember the signal
I would call
And how you would look at me
In faith and admiration
And say “Let’s go”...
How the lines would clash
And strain,
And how I would find an opening,
A wee small space,
Amidst tangling arms and torsos,
And how I would slip through
Fighting and squirming
Over the line
To victory.
You remember, Chick?
When you gaze at me here
Let that same light
Of faith and admiration
Shine in your eyes
For I have battered the stark stonewall
Before me. 
I have kept faith with you
And now
I have called my signal,
Found my opening
And slipped through
Fighting and squirming
Over the line
To victory.

To Wanda

To you, so far away
So cold and aloof, -
To you, who knew me so well,
This is my last Grand Gesture
This my last Great Effect
And as I go winging
Through the black doors of eternity
Is that thin sound I hear
Your applause? .....

The Weary Blues,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
   I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
   He did a lazy sway. . . . 
   He did a lazy sway. . . . 
To the tune o' those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
   O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
   Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man's soul.
   O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan
   ""Ain't got nobody in all this world,
   Ain't got nobody but ma self.
   I's gwine to quit ma frownin'
   And put ma troubles on the shelf.”
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more
   ""I got the Weary Blues
   And I can't be satisfied.
   Got the Weary Blues
   And can't be satisfied
   I ain't happy no mo'
   And I wish that I had died.”
      And far into the night he crooned that tune.
      The stars went out and so did the moon.

      While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.

A Song to a Negro Wash-woman,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"Oh, wash-woman,
Arms elbow-deep in white suds,
Soul washed clean,
Clothes washed clean,—
I have many songs to sing you
Could I but find the words.
Was it four o'clock or six o'clock on a winter afternoon, I saw you wringing out the last shirt in Miss White Lady's kitchen? Was it four o'clock or six o'clock? I don't remember.
But I know, at seven one spring morning you were on Vermont Street with a bundle in your arms going to wash clothes.
And I know I've seen you in a New York subway train in the late afternoon coming home from washing clothes.
Yes, I know you, wash-woman.
I know how you send your children to school, and high-school, and even college.
I know how you work and help your man when times are hard.
I know how you build your house up from the wash-tub and call it home.
And how you raise your churches from white suds for the service of the Holy God.
And I've seen you singing, wash-woman. Out in the backyard garden under the apple trees, singing, hanging white clothes on long lines in the sun-shine.
And I've seen you in church a Sunday morning singing, praising your Jesus, because some day you're going to sit on the right hand of the Son of God and forget you ever were a wash-woman. And the aching back and the bundles of clothes will be unremembered then.
Yes, I've seen you singing.
And for you,
   O singing wash-woman,
   For you, singing little brown woman,
   Singing strong black woman,
   Singing tall yellow woman,
   Arms deep in white suds,
   Soul clean,
   Clothes clean,—

Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,
Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift

Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay,

When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away;
Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep,
For sunken water, fluid underground,
Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep,
And queer things of the nether world abound:
So would I live in rich imperial growth,
Touching the surface and the depth of things,
Instinctively responsive unto both,
Tasting the sweets of being and the stings,
Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms,
Like a strong tree against a thousand storms.",March,1925,Survey Graphic,Alain Locke,Sonnet,male,,The New Negro,New York,Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theft,Esther Popel,Popel,"The moon
Was an old, old woman, tonight,
Hurrying home;
Calling pitifully to her children,
The stars,
Begging them to go home with her
For she was afraid,
But they would not.
They only laughed
While she crept along
Huddling against the dark blue wall of the Night
Stooping low,
Her old black hood wrapped close about her ears,
And only the pale curve of her yellow cheek
With a tear in the hollow of it
Showing through.
And the wind laughed too,
For he was teasing the old woman,
Pelting her with snowballs,
Filling her old eyes with the flakes of them, Making her cold.
She stumbled along, shivering,
And once she fell,
And the snow buried her;
And all her jewels
Slid from the old bag
Under her arm
And fell to earth,
And the tall trees seized them,
And hung them about their necks,
And filled their bony arms with them.
All their nakedness was covered by her jewel
‘And they would not give them back to her.
The old moon-woman moaned piteously, Hurrying home;
And the wild wind laughed at her
And her children laughed too,
And the tall trees taunted her

That Yaller Gal (La. 1924),Edna Porter,Porter,"Mr. John, listen to me:
Don't pull any foolish stunt.
And don't make another move.
Just keep your hand closed up tight.
Nothing you think of doing
Can ever make me afraid —
Fear died in me long ago.
You may live in the Big House
And own all the land in sight:
But you can't get me, unless,
You come across as I bid.
And hear all I have to say.
You and I are related —
You don't like that do you?
Well, its true, nevertheless.
It doesn't matter to me.
Now that I see things clearly.
Great-grandmother, a victim
With all the rest of her tribe.
Paying the price of slavery
Down thru the generations.
Wasn't I just a love-child.
Killing my mother at birth?
Then grandmother did washings
To send me to school to learn.
To learn that I have freedom
And I belong to myself!
Now, you're standing there begging.
Willing to eat from my hand:
Before, you offered a coin.
Thinking I'd jump at the chance.
Some poor devils would, maybe.
Black-white-red-vellow or brown.
Skin doesn't matter, really.
When a man gets excited.
I know you, you White-Blackguard!
You low ""Yaller Gal"" Coward!
You're wild about my color.
I can see it in your eyes.
You've forgotten your woman.
Alone there in the Big House —
A wife has a thankless part—
Why, she'll love vou for nothing.
And be happy at the tho't.
But no, you are'nt satisfied.
You want everything you see :
And sometimes you crave blindly
For the very soul of me.
When you were a little boy
They whipped you on mv account :
I wept my aching heart out
While you bore it like a man
And came bringing me candy
As soon as you stole away.
Now, you're grown up and vou come
With that pitiful ""two-bits"" —
Thinking I'll fall, you cheap-skate!
Well, you've got me dead wrong, see?
Oh, I'm for sale allright, sure :
But its at my price, not yours.
I'll not give myself away.
I'll sell you my stock in trade—
Its the oldest in the world.
You can buy me, yes indeed.
Only let me tell vou this:

A Poster,George Franklin Proctor,Proctor,"It is Saturday night.
The place is crowded
And such a crowd!
It is neither black nor white,
Brown nor yellow There are all colors,
There are all manners of peopleI
Here and there, you may catch
Blue-tinted by the smoke
A glimpse of an oriental face
The lights of the place are as manv-hued
As the faces of the people
Wine and Whiskey are poured like oil
Into the fire of Youth,
Causing leaping, ambitious flames
Giving added brightness to maiden eves
Which seem to say, ""There is fire within, Beware!"" -
Old men and women are here, too
Their glimmering coals are fanned to heat anew
Soul endangering,
Which consume their dry old carcasses.
There comes a whirl of noise
Like the breaking of a storm.
There is a hint of harmony--
A bit of melody.
Five men, black, brown and yellow
Contortionists of notes, instruments
And bodies, make music.
At once, there is wild motion!
Motion that defies description
Each couple improvising movements.
Those most inflamed by wine, music
Or close embraces,
Surpass their fellows.
My eyes follow couple after couple.
There is a brown girl, a wild thing,
Graceful as rippling silk,
With eyes that laugh over the shoulders of a
Bold boy
Whose ancestors might have been Vikings,
So big and strong is he.
They whirl on and I lose them in the crowd,
Only to be attracted by a Chinese lad
Dancing gaily with a maiden of the Occident.
He holds her closely-- His face expressionless.
The girl is smiling
No, she is Iaughing!
He whispers something with a swift side-wise glance.
She tosses back her pretty head
And laughs and laughs and laughs!
A little brown haired girl
With a Lothario long withered
Who would cheat Time with such a play-mate
Flirts boldly with a brown youngster.
Who has the look of neither toiling
Nor spinning,
He is good-looking, I think
Yet, too smooth-looking, too finished in
His knife-creased clothes.
He hints of marked cards--bounty paving women--
Yet-Satyrs grown gross pouched and bald
Are damn poor jazzing mates!

Hymn to America,E. Lucien Waithe,Waithe,"America I sing to you
A hymn of love mixed with my tears,
A hymn made up of thoughts that spring
From many, many cruel years.
I love you my America
Who would not want to call me yours ;
With all the wrongs that hemmed me in
I stood up to defend your doors.
Before I knew time, place, or scene,
My mother kept before my view
Your emblem lighted with the stars,
Which I still saw there as I grew.
And when I saw out in the bay
Shining above all other glare
The light that burns throughout the night,
I smiled and said I need not fear.
I thought it then a light to love,
To liberty and every good ;
But that was false — a light to hell
I found it soon after I stood
Upon the hill where Life took me
To view the things that are as rare,
To feel the teeth of poverty
And pull at opportunity's bar.
I had high hopes, bright dreams were mine,
A future roseate as the light
That limns the shadows of the hills
Against the sky as dawn grows bright.
Too soon hate's dark eclipse hid all
The brightness of this day of hope;
And your weak pride narrowed and bound
My every effort, every scope.
But still America I lived
Scourged by the jeers, the taunts, the scorn ;
Why should some men inherit love
And some to such strong hate be born ?
America I pay with love
For all the hate you give to me;
I take your jagged-edge cup and drink
The drug of dark hate fearlessly.
I know it can but drug the sense.
And hold ambition to the earth ;
For hate can never conquer me,
Nor wrong rob me of all my mirth.
I shall still cry, shall laugh and play
Until some larger heart should come
To light yours into flames of love
That burn for all and not for some.
And still a dream is in my soul
In which I see you handing me
A golden star of membership
In this great world's fraternity.
Then from the ruins of much wrong,
Within the shining shop of right
I'll forge for you a tower wherefrom
Shall gleam earth's purest brightest light.
Then all the nations of this world
Shall look to you and call you great ;
Because your light shall shine afar
When one large love replaces hate. ",August,1925,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,male,"Racism, America",,New York,Predom. Black,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40654465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golgotha Is a Mountain,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"Golgotha is a mountain, a purple mound
Almost out of sight.
One night they hanged two thieves there,
And another man.
Some women wept heavily that night;
Their tears are flowing still. They have made a river;
Once it covered me.
Then the people went away and left Golgotha
Deserted.
Oh, I've seen many mountains:
Pale purple mountains melting in the evening mists and blurring on the borders of the sky.
I climbed old Shasta and chilled my hands in its summer snows.
I rested in the shadow of Popocatepetl and it whispered to me of daring prowess.
I looked upon the Pyrenees and felt the zest of warm exotic nights.
I slept at the foot of Fujiyama and dreamed of legend and of death.
And I've seen other mountains rising from the wistful moors like the breasts of a slender maiden.
Who knows the mystery of mountains!
Some of them are awful, others are just lonely.
...
Italy has its Rome and California has San Francisco,
All covered with mountains.
Some think these mountains grew
Like ant hills
Or sand dunes.
That might be so —
I wonder what started them all!
Babylon is a mountain
And so is Nineveh,
With grass growing on them;
Palaces and hanging gardens started them.
I wonder what is under the hills
In Mexico
And Japan!
There are mountains in Africa too.
Treasure is buried there:
Gold and precious stones
And moulded glory.
Lush grass is growing there
Sinking before the wind.
Black men are bowing.
Naked in that grass
Digging with their fingers.
I am one of them:
Those mountains should be ours.
It would be great
To touch the pieces of glory with our hands.
These mute unhappy hills,
Bowed down with broken backs,
Speak often one to another:
"" A day is as a year, "" they cry,
"" And a thousand years as one day. ""
We watched the caravan
That bore our queen to the courts of Solomon;
And when the first slave traders came
We bowed our heads.
""Oh, Brothers, it is not long!
Dust shall yet devour the stones
But we shall be here when they are gone. ""
Mountains are rising all around me.
Some are so small they are not seen;
Others are large.
All of them get big in time and people forget
What started them at first.
Oh the world is covered with mountains!
Beneath each one there is something buried:
Some pile of wreckage that started it there.
Mountains are lonely and some are awful.

Nocturne at Bethesda,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"This poem won the first prize of $75 in The Crisis prize contest of 1926.

I thought I saw an angel flying low,
I thought I saw the flicker of a wing
Above the mulberry trees; but not again.
Bethesda sleeps. This ancient pool that healed
A host of bearded Jews does not awake.

This pool that once the angels troubled does not move
No angel stirs it now, no Saviour comes
With healing in His hands to raise the sick
And bid the lame man leap upon the ground.

The golden days are gone. Why do we wait
So long upon the marble steps, blood
Falling from our open wounds? and why
Do our black faces search the empty sky?
Is there something we have forgotten? some precious thing
We have lost, wandering in strange lands?

There was a day, I remember now,
I beat my breast and cried, “Wash me God,
Wash me with a wave of wind upon
The barley; O quiet One, draw near, draw near!
Walk upon the hills with lovely feet
And in the waterfall stand and speak.

“Dip white hands in the lily pool and mourn
Upon the harps still hanging in the trees
Near Babylon along the river's edge,
But oh, remember me, I pray, before
The summer goes and rose leaves lose their red.”

The old terror takes my heart, the fear
Of quiet waters and of faint twilights.
There will be better days when I am gone
And healing pools where I cannot be healed.
Fragrant stars will gleam forever and ever
Above the place where I lie desolate.

Yet I hope, still I long to live.
And if there can be returning after death
I shall come back. But it will not be here;
If you want me you must search for me
Beneath the palms of Africa. Or if
I am not there then you may call to me
Across the shining dunes, perhaps I shall
Be following a desert caravan.

I may pass through centuries of death
With quiet eyes, but I'll remember still
A jungle tree with burning scarlet birds.
There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing.
I shall be seeking ornaments of ivory,
I shall be dying for a jungle fruit.
You do not hear, Bethesda.
O still green water in a stagnant pool!
Love abandoned you and me alike.
There was a day you held a rich full moon
Upon your heart and listened to the words
Of men now dead and saw the angels fly.
There is a simple story on your face;
Years have wrinkled you. I know, Bethesda!
You are sad. It is the same with me.

Age and Autumn,William Stanley Braithwaite,Braithwaite,"Where now is the blaze that hung intense

And makes the sunshine weary and mellow
And the flowers wither, and green leaves yellow?

The Tragedy of Pete,Joseph S. Cotter,Cotter,"There was a man
—Whose name was Pete,
And he was a buck
—From his head to his feet.
He loved a dollar,
—But hated a dime;
And so was poor
—Nine-tenths of the time.
The Judge said “Pete,
—What of your wife?”
And Pete replied
—“She lost her life.”
“Pete,” said the Judge,
—“Was it lost in a row?
Tell me quick,
—And tell me how.”
Pete straightened up
—With a hic and a sigh,
Then looked the Judge
—Full in the eye.
“O, Judge, my wife
—Would never go
To a Sunday dance
—Or a movie show.
“But I went, Judge,
—Both day and night,
And came home broke
—And also tight.
“The moon was up,
—My purse was down,
And I was the bully
—Of the bootleg town.
“I was crooning a lilt
—To corn and rye
For the loop in my legs
—And the fight in my eye.
“I met my wife;
—She was wearing a frown,
And catechising
—Her Sunday gown.
“ ‘O Pete, O Pete’
—She cried aloud,
‘The Devil is falling
—Right out of a cloud.’
“I looked straight up
—And fell flat down
And a Ford machine
—Pinned my head to the ground.
“The Ford moved on,
—And my wife was in it;
And I was sober,
—That very minute.
“For my head was bleeding,
—My heart was a-flutter;
And the moonshine within me
—Was tipping the gutter.
“The Ford, it faster
—And faster sped
Till it dipped and swerved
—And my wife was dead.
“Two bruised men lay
—In a hospital ward—
One seeking vengeance,
—The other the Lord.
“He said to me:
—‘Your wife was drunk,
You are crazy,
—And my Ford is junk.’
“I raised my knife
—And drove it in
At the top of his head
—And the point of his chin.

—If the State has a chair,
Please bind me in it

On the money from a white woman’s kitchen?
And: Ain’t there any joy in this town?

Now the streets down by the river
Know more about this pretty Ruby Brown,
And the sinister shuttered houses of the Bottoms
Hold a yellow girl

Pay more money to her now than they ever did before,
When she worked in their kitchens.

To buy a paper from a breathless boy,
And read of kings and queens in foreign lands,
Hyperbole of romance and adventure,
All for a penny the color of my hand.
To lean against a strong tree's bosom, sentient
And hushed before the silent prayer it breathes,
To melt the still snow with my seething body
And kiss the warm earth tremulous underneath.

And to die bleeding — consummate with Life.",June,1926,Opportunity,Charles S. Johnson,,female,"Travel-Migration-Great Migration, Prize-winning",Carolina Magazine (1927),New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Magalu,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"Summer comes.
The ziczac hovers
'Round the greedy-mouthed crocodile.
A vulture bears away a foolish jackal.
The flamingo is a dash of pink
Against dark green mangroves,
Her slender legs rivalling her slim neck.
The laughing lake gurgles delicious music in its throat
And lulls to sleep the lazy lizard,
A nebulous being on a sun-scorched rock.
In such a place,
In this pulsing, riotous gasp of color,
I met Magalu, dark as a tree at night,
Eager-lipped, listening to a man with a white collar
And a small black book with a cross on it.
Oh Magalu, come! Take my hand and I will read you poetry,
Chromatic words,
Seraphic symphonies,
Fill up your throat with laughter and your heart with song.
Do not let him lure you from your laughing waters,
Lulling lakes, lissome winds.
Would you sell the colors of your sunset and the fragrance
Of your flowers, and the passionate wonder of your forest

Bottled,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"Upstairs on the third floor
Of the 135th Street library
In Harlem, I saw a little
Bottle of sand, brown sand
Just like the kids make pies
Out of down at the beach.
But the label said: “This
Sand was taken from the Sahara desert.”
Imagine that! The Sahara desert!
Some bozo's been all the way to Africa to get some sand.
And yesterday on Seventh Avenue
I saw a darky dressed fit to kill
In yellow gloves and swallow tail coat
And swirling a cane. And everyone
Was laughing at him. Me too,
At first, till I saw his face
When he stopped to hear a
Organ grinder grind out some jazz.
Boy! You should a seen that darky's face!
It just shone. Gee, he was happy!
And he began to dance. No
Charleston or Black Bottom for him.
No sir. He danced just as dignified
And slow. No, not slow either.
Dignified and proud! You couldn't
Call it slow, not with all the
Cuttin' up he did. You would a died to see him.
The crowd kept yellin' but he didn't hear,
Just kept on dancin' and twirlin' that cane
And yellin' out loud every once in a while.
I know the crowd thought he was coo-coo.
But say, I was where I could see his face,
And somehow, I could see him dancin' in a jungle,
A real honest-to-cripe jungle, and he wouldn't have on them
Trick clothes—those yaller shoes and yaller gloves
And swallow-tail coat. He wouldn't have on nothing.
And he wouldn't be carrying no cane.
He'd be carrying a spear with a sharp fine point
Like the bayonets we had “over there.""
And the end of it would be dipped in some kind of
Hoo-doo poison. And he'd be dancin' black and naked and gleaming.
And he'd have rings in his ears and on his nose
And bracelets and necklaces of elephants' teeth.
Gee, I bet he'd be beautiful then all right.
No one would laugh at him then, I bet.
Say! That man that took that sand from the Sahara desert
And put it in a little bottle on a shelf in the library,
That's what they done to this shine, ain't it? Bottled him.

Fiat Lux,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"Her eyes had caught a bit of loveliness,
A flower blooming in the prison yard;
She ran to it and pressed it to her lips,
This Godsend of a land beyond the walls;
She drank its divine beauty with her kiss.
A guard wrested the flower from her hand--
With awful art her humble back laid bare,
Soft skin and darker than a dreamless night;
He tossed aside the burden of her hair.
""I'll teach you to pick flowers in this yard.
They ain't for n*****s."" He began to flog.
Her pale palmed hands grasped the thin air in quest
Until, like two antalgic words, they fell
And whispered something to her heaving breast.
Then she forgot the misery of her back.
Somehow she knew that God, her God was there:
That what was pain was but her striped flesh.
Her soul, inviolate, was havened in prayer.
On a cross of bigotry she was crucified
Because she was not white. And like her Father
On the holyrood, whispered ""Forgive.""
And in her eyes there shone a Candlemas light.
He flung the whip into the flower bed
He did not even see that she was dead. ",July,1926,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen",,female,"Incarceration, Racism, Lynching and Racialized Violence",Opportunity,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of viewing life from our own lofty heights.

Negro Street Serenade (In the South),Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"The quavering zigzag of the fiddle’s notes;
The thumping “tum-tum” of the banjo and guitar;
The gauzy quiver, flutter of the fiddle;
The measured muffled thud of that guitar!
And then a voice breaks forth—
Loose, careless, mellow—
A wealth of voice that rolls, soars,
Rolls and falls,
A reveling, rich voice,
Deeper than the banjo’s;
With more of melody than fiddles’ trebles,
Yet with that subtle minor trembling through 
Which shakes the viol’s slender vibrance
As the winds might—
And all of this out in a half-hushed autumn dusk!
The autumn air itself is tense, suspended,
And into this that most spontaneous song!
Which ripples on and floats and floats
Midst “thum” of banjo
And rhythmic background of that constant taut guitar,
And travels with the wavers of the fiddle,
To float and rise and rest with moon and star!

Happiness and Death,Edward S. Silvera,Silvera,"Happiness

I went in quest of happiness
Upon a golden mountain
But she was in the plain below
Beside the public fountain.

I sought her in the sea-blue waves
And singing sun-lit billows
But she was in the placid stream
Beneath the shady willows.

I looked for her in city crowds
That filled the great white way
But found her on a lowly farm,
A milkmaid, tawny, gay.

Death

   Thump, thump, thump.
My heart keeps a knockin',--

Then my heart ain’t gonna knock no more

     Like a slim dark maiden,
Crowned with blossoms sunset-pale,
     Dream-perfumed, dew-laden.

Black as midnight were her eyes,
     Crinkly-dark her tresses,
Sunbeams, flickering from the skies
     Wooed her with caresses.

Lingering but an instant’s space,
     All my heart entrancing,
Swift and sweet, her warm embrace
     Stirred my blood to dancing.

But when Night, in splendor rare,
     Set her love-lamps gleaming,
Dusk had fled, and left me there
     Lone, and lorn, and dreaming.

To a Negro Musician,George Leonard Allen,Allen,"Brown slender fingers on the ivory keys,
What is the strange alluring theme you play?
Whence came those rhythms, wild and sad and gay,
And whence those weird, exotic harmonies?
Where did you find such cadences as these
Which seem, in fierce abandon, to portray
The rhythmic beat of tom-toms far away,
The wild wind sighing through the jungle trees?
Thrilled by the subtle magic of your spell,
Methinks I see fantastic scenes arise
Of weird, strange dances in some sunlit dell
Beneath the splendor of the tropic skies;
And fancy bears me far across the earth

To a Dark Girl,Gwendolyn B. Bennett,Bennett,"I love you for your brownness
And the rounded darkness of your breast.
I love you for the breaking sadness in your voice
And shadows where your wayward eye-lids rest.
Something of old forgotten queens
Lurks in the lithe abandon of your walk

The Return,Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"I 
 
Once more, listening to the wind and rain, 
Once more, you and I, and above the hurting sound 
Of these comes back the throbbing of remembered rain, 
Treasured rain falling on dark ground. 
Once more, huddling birds upon the leaves 
And summer trembling on a withered vine. 
And once more, returning out of pain, 
The friendly ghost that was your love and mine. 
 
 II 
 
The throb of rain is the throb of muffled drums; 
Darkness brings the jungle to our room. 
Darkness hangs our room with pendulums 
Of vine and in the gathering gloom 
Our walls recede into a denseness of 
Surrounding trees. This is a night of love 
Retained from those lost nights our fathers slept 
In huts; this is a night that cannot die. 
Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept 
And tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky. 
 
III 

The downpour ceases. 
Let us go back, you and I, and dance 
Once more upon the glimmering leaves 
And as the throbbing of drums increases 
Shake the grass and the drippimg boughs of trees. 
A ary wind stirs the palm; the old tree grieves. 
Lime has charged the years and they have returned. 
Then let us dance by metal waters burned 
With gold of moon, let us dance 
With naked feet beneath the young spice trees. 
What was that light, that radiance 
On your face?—something I saw when first 
You passed beneath the jungle tapestries? 
A moment we pause to quench our thirst 
Kneeling at the water’s edge, the gleam 
Upon your face is plain; you have wanted this, 
Oh let us go back and search the tangled dream 
And as the muffled-drum-beats throb and miss 
Remember again how. early darkness comes 
 To dreams and silence to the drums. 
 
IV 
 
Let us go back into the dusk again, 
Slow and sad-like following the track 
Of blown leaves and cool white rain 
Into the old grey dreams; let us go back. 
Our walls close about us, we lie and listen 
To the noise of the street, the storm and the driven birds. 
A question shapes your lips, your eyes glisten 
 Retaining tears, but there are no more words. ",July,1927,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",,male,"Africa, Dance, Prize-winning","Ebony and Topaz, Caroling Dusk",New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arna_Bontemps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the deep, cold watches of gloom.

Old Mansion (1927),Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"Old Mansion
By Arna Bontemps
Poplars are standing there still as death
And ghosts of dead men
Meet their ladies walking
Two by two beneath the shade
And standing on the marble steps.
There is a sound of music
Echoing through the door
And in the field there is
Another sound tinkling in the cotton:
Chains of bondsmen dragging on the ground.
The years go back with an iron clank.
A hand is on the gate,
A dry leaf trembles on the wall.
Ghosts are walking.
They have broken roses down
And poplars stand there still as death. ",May,1927,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,,male,Slavery,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arna_Bontemps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wait for me beside the slender tree
And I will see you there and come at last.

To One Who Might Have Been My Friend ,Nellie R. Bright,Bright,"Do you remember how that glowing morn
We stood hands clasped beside an amber pool
Of lilies pale as your fair skin, and cool
On my brown cheek was the misty breath of dawn?
You said, ""We too are friends, for we were born
To dwell at beauty's shrine. There is no rule
That being brown and fair, we play the fool
'Til friendship flee, a tarnished gleam forlorn.""
'Twas then I saw amid the thin-leaved grass
Th souls of dead men and men yet to be;
Blue fires, old thrilling hopes that leaped and died
When you in dread, a childhood friend espied--
And seeing his slow smile, you shrank from me--
Then, ... my faith dead ... I turned ... and ... let ... you pass.",December,1927,Black Opals,Gwendolyn Bennett,Sonnet,female,Interracial,Carolina Magazine,Philadelphia,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Rathbone_Bright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Query ,Nellie R. Bright,Bright,"Great wonder that my blood spurts ruby read
And not a green and slimy stream instead--
That all my tears are salt, not bigger gall,
That I sill live, and love and laught at all!
And that my teeth are lustrous, pearly white,
Instead of blue cold blades that clash at night.
Why do you stand aloof and bid me pray,
You who sow strife and pain upon my way?
How does my soul live on mauled by hate's rod?

Longings ,Nellie R. Bright,Bright,"I want to slay all the things just things
That they tell me I must do,

I want to flee to a cool sand dune
On a wind-swept beach where the humming tune
Of the wind, and the waves, and the heart of me
Drums in my ears, and my lips are wet with the tang of the sea.
I want to feel the rain on my cheek,
The thrill that comes from a lark’s long note,
I want to see the sky at dawn thru the lacy green of a willow tree
I want to look deep in a pool at night, and see the stars
Flash flame like the fire in black opals.",Spring,1927,Black Opals,"Nellie R. Bright, Arthur Huff Fauset, Allan Randal Freelon, James H. Young",Free verse,female,,,Philadelphia,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Rathbone_Bright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Resurrection,Jonathan H. Brooks,Brooks,"His friends went off and left Him dead
in Joseph's subterranean bed,
Embalmed with myrrh and sweet aloes,
And wrapped in snow-white burial clothes.
Then shrewd men came and set a seal
Upon His grave, lest thieves should steal
His lifeless form away, and claim
For Him an undeserving fame.
“There is no use,” the soldiers said,
“Of standing sentries by the dead.”
Wherefore, they drew their cloaks around
Themselves, and fell upon the ground,
And slept like dead men, all night through,
In the pale moonlight and chilling dew.
A muffled whiff of sudden breath
Ruffled the passive air of death.
He woke, and raised Himself in bed;
Recalled how He was crucified;
Touched both hand's fingers to His head,
And lightly felt His fresh-healed side,
Then with a deep, triumphant sigh,
He coolly put His grave-clothes by—
Folded the sweet, white winding sheet,
     The toweling, the linen bands,
The napkin, all with careful hands—
And left the borrowed chamber neat.
His steps were like the breaking day:
So soft across the watch He stole,
He did not wake a single soul,
Nor spill one dewdrop by the way.
Now Calvary was loveliness:
     Lilies that flowered thereupon
Pulled off the white moon's pallid dress,
     And put the morning's vesture on.
“Why seek the living among the dead?
He is not here,” the angel said.
The early winds took up the words,
And bore them to the lilting birds,
The leafing trees, and everything
That breathed the living breath of spring.",September,1927,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",,male,Religion,,New York,Predom. Black,https://poets.org/poet/jonathan-henderson-brooks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foreclosure,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"Father Missouri takes his own.

Here are the banks he built up for his children— 
Here are the fields; rich, fertile silt.

Guts away the banks; steals away the loam; 
Washes the ground from under wire fences, 
Leaves fenceposts grotesquely dangling in the air; 
And with doddering steps approaches the shanties.

Seeing his white leghorns swept down the stream— 
 
Curses Father Missouri, impotently shakes 
His fist at the forecloser, the treacherous skinflint, 
Who takes what was loaned so very long ago, 
And leaves puddles in his parlor, and useless lakes 
In his fine pasture land. 
Sees years of work turned to nothing— 
Curses, and shouts in his hoarse old voice,

And the old river rolls on, slowly to the gulf. ",December,1927,Ebony and Topaz,Charles S. Johnson,,male,Agriculture- Environment,,New York,Predom.

When de Saints Go Ma'ching Home,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"He'd play, after the bawdy songs and blues,
After the weary plaints
Of “Trouble, Trouble deep down in muh soul,”
Always one song in which he'd lose the role
Of entertainer to the boys. He'd say
“My mother’s favorite.” And we knew
That what was coming was his chant of saints
“When de Saints go ma’chin home
And that would end his concert for the day.

Carefully as an old maid over needlework,
Oh, as some black deacon, over his Bible, lovingly,
He'd tune up specially for this. There'd be
No chatter now, no patting of the feet.
After a few slow chords, knelling and sweet
Oh when de saints go ma’chin home
Oh when de sayaints goa ma'chin home
He would forget
The quieted bunch, his dimming cigarette
Stuck into a splintered edge of the guitar.
Sorrow deep hidden in his voice, a far
And soft light in his strange brown eyes;
Alone with his masterchords, his memories. . .
   Lawd I wanna be one in nummer
   When de saints go ma’chin home.
Deep the bass would rumble while the treble, scattered high
For all the world like heavy feet a trompin’ toward the sky.
With shrillvoiced women getting ‘happy’
All to celestial tunes.
The chap’s few speeches helped me understand
The reason why he gazed so fixedly
Upon the burnished strings.
For he would see
A gorgeous procession to ‘de Beulah Land’
Of Saints—his friends—‘a climbin’ fo’ deir wings.’
Oh when de saints go ma’chin home
Lawd I wanna be one o’ dat nummer
When de saints goa ma’chin home...

With that red brakemen who once let him ride

Who paid his songs with board and drink and bed?
Or with the Yankee Cap'n who left a leg
At Vicksburg? ‘Mought be a place, he said

But saints and heaven didn’t seem to fit
Jes rite wid Sophy’s Beauty—nary bit
She mought stir trouble, somehow, in dat peaceful place

She got a dear ole modder
She is in hebben I know
He sees
Mammy
L‘il mammy—wrinkled face
Her brown eyes, quick to tears—to joy
With such happy pride in her
Guitar plunkin’ boy.
Oh kain't I be one in nummer?
Mammy
With deep religion defeating the grief
Life piled so closely about her
Ise so glad trouble doan last ‘alway’
And her dogged belief
That some fine day
She'd go a machin
When de saints go ma'chin home.
He sees her ma’chin home, ma’chin along,
Her perky joy shining in her furrowed face,
Her weak and quavering voice singing her song—
The best chair set apart for her worn out body
In that restful place . . .
I pray to de Lawd I'll meet her
When de saints go ma’chin home.

6. 

He'd shuffle off from us, always, at that,
His face a brown study beneath his torn brimmed hat
His broad shoulders slouching, his old box strung
Around his neck;—he’d go where we
Never could follow him—to Sophie probably,
Or to his dances--in old Tinbridge flat.

After the Storm,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"There is pathetic beauty in it all;
       O’erhead the murky, sullen rainclouds pass,
       The sun’s first darting rays have pierced the mass,
Just now so grim, so gray. Again the call
Is heard of storm-hushed robins. Maples-tall,
       To show the regal silver of their class,
       Rustle their thirst-slaked leaves and on the grass,
Drenched into higher colog, some last drops fall.

’Tis like that heart, whose happiness excelled
       All others, which, with its gay threshold crossed
            At last by sorrow’s gloom, has fitly learned
To stifle throes of pain, has ne’er rebelled
             In angry bitterness, has merely turned
Gayness to pathos, with no beauty lost.

Rainy Season Love Song,Gladys May Casey Hayford,Casely-Hayford,"Out of the tense awed darkness, my Frangepani
       comes;
Whilst the blades of Heaven flash round her, and
       the roll of thunder drums,
My young heart leaps and dances, with exquisite
       joy and pain,
As storms within and storms without I meet my
       love in the rain.
“The rain is in love with you darling; it’s kissing
       you everywhere,
Rain pattering over your small brown feet, rain
       in your curly hair;
Rain in the vale that your twin breasts make, as
       in delicate mounds they rise,
I hope there is rain in your heart, Frangepani, as
        rain half fills your eyes.”
Into my hands she cometh, and the lightning of my
       desire
Flashes and leaps about her, more subtle than
       Heaven's fire;
“The lightning’s in love with you darling; it is
       loving you so much,
That its warm electricity in you pulses wherever
       I may touch.
When I kiss your lips and your eyes, and your
       hands like twin flowers apart,
I know there is lightning Frangepani, deep in the
       depths of your heart.”

       its power in your breast.
And I feel it stealing o'er me as I lie in your arms

       life’s proffered bowl,
Whether there's thunder hidden in the innermost
       parts of your soul.”

Apology (1927),Carllie Williams Clifford,Clifford,"Forgive me that my voice is low,
And charged with sorrow my brief song,
For I must sing—though brokenly,
Who have been mute so long! 
I cannot run the gamut through,
The compass of my voice is small,
My range is slight, but I must heed
My heart's insistent call!
These flutings, faint, a portent are,
Of what the future years may bring,
When soaring high, unfettered, free,
My 'raptured soul shall sing!
And though this plaintive pleading now,
Irks with its minor, wistful wailing,
You feel the passion, sense the power,
Which yet may prove availing.

Is zealous ardor, fervent feeling;
And deep emotion's cleansing flame,

Matter who stoops
To cast the first stone.

Soar above these feeble

From prejudice’s womb
And nursed by tradition?

Of darkness that rises
From gleaming day
And seeks to hide the sun.

And soft arms cradle me on your sweet
Brown breast..........for I have grown old

Poised like a slender dagger

’Neath the bamboo trees
On the sable breast
Of earth—
And listen to the wind.

To croon—
Weird sweet melodies
Round the cabin door
With banjos clinking softly—
And from out the shadow
Hear the beat of tom-toms
Resonant through the years.

To plunge—
My brown body
In a golden pool,
And lazily float on the swell
Watching the rising sun.

To stand—
On a purple mountain
Hidden from earth
By mists of dreams
And tears—

To talk—
With God.

Lamps,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"Bodies are lamps
And their life is the light.
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony—
Yet all are lamps
And their lives the lights.

Dwelling in the tabernacles
    Of the most high—are lamps.
Lighting the weary pilgrims’ way
    As they travel the dreary night—are lamps.
Swinging aloft in great Cathedrals
    Beaming on rich and poor alike—are lamps.
Flickering fitfully in harlot dives
    Wanton as they that dwell therein— are lamps.
Ivory, Gold, Bronze and Ebony—
Yet all are lamps
And their lives the lights.

Some flames rise high above the horizon
    And urge others to greater power.
Some burn steadfast thru the night
    To welcome the prodigal home.
Others flicker weakly, lacking oil to burn
    And slowly die unnoticed.
What matter how bright the flame
    How weak?
What matter how high it blazes
    How low?
A puff of wind will put it out.

You and I are lamps—Ebony lamps,
Our flame glows red and rages high within
But our ebon shroud becomes a shadow
And our light seems weak and low.
    Break that shadow
    And let the flame illumine heaven
    Or blow wind…blow
    And let our feeble lights go out.

Plying a strange and unaccustomed tongue,
An alien to the daily round of talk,
Mute when the sordid songs of earth are sung.

To shoulder his own coffin up the steep,
Incredulous summit that shapes his doom

And will the flame burn steady to the end,
Until we round that dark and dangerous bend
Where.there is such a crying need for light;
Or will it flare up now so clear and bright,
Sunlike its wealth so far and wide distend
That nothing will remain for us to spend
When toll is taken by the dismal night?
Why shculd I harrow up my mind like this, 
To tarnish with a doubt each golden kiss?

Us now from any hidden darkness spun;
Sufficient to the day let be the sun,
And to the night the spear-points of the stars.

By COUNTEE CULLEN

Cnce in a thousand years a call may ring
Divested so of every cumbering lie
A man espousing it may fight and sing,
And count it but a little thing to die;
Once in a thousand years a star may come
Six-pointed, tipped with such an astral flow
It’s singing sisters must bow hushed dumb,
Half-mutinous, yet half-adoring show;
Once in as many years a man may rise
So cosmopolitan of thought and speech,
Humanity reflected in his eyes,
His heart a haven every race may reach,
That doubters shall receive a mortal thrust,
And own “This man proves flesh exalts its dust”.

Pain is no patriot;

Seeking an oriflamme,

Now never shall a piquant face 
Cause my tutored heart a trace

A simulacrum of disguise 
Masked the serpent and the dove; 
That I discern now hiss from coo, 
My heart's full gratitude to you, 
Lady I had learned to love.

Many a polished pain and pang, 
With proper bardic zeal;

Has made them wounds may heal. ",December ,1927,Ebony and Topaz,Charles S. Johnson,,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An Old Story ,Countee Cullen,Cullen,"“I must be ready when he comes,” she said,
“Besieger of the heart, the long adored;
And I shall know him by his regal tread,
And by the grace peculiar to my lord.
Upon my mouth his lips shall be a sword;
Splendid is he by whom this breast shall fall,
This hive of honey burst, this fruit be cored.”
So beauty that would be a willing thrall
Kept vigil, eyes aglow, ear tuned to hear his call.
Had she not had her dream, she might have seen
For what he was the stranger at her gate,
And known his rugged hands, strong mouth, and lean
Hawk-face spelled out for her a star-spun fate.
But captive to a dream she let him wait
In vain for any word she might have said
Whereat he might declare himself her mate.
She looked him through as one unknown or dead;
He passed, an unseen halo blazing round his head.
The grave will be her only lover now,
Though still she watches for the shining one,
Her prince in purple robes, with flaming brow,
Astride a wild steed lineaged from the sun.
Season to season shades, the long days run
To longer years; she still is waiting there,
Not knowing long ago her siege was done,
Not dreaming it has been her bitter share
To entertain her heart’s high guest all unaware.",May,1927,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,,male,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past, whose shrouded sorrow is
A sign the fates have set us.

No mock was yours to us unknown.

Learn from you in whom our seed is sown.

To see where it would stop;
A tree sprang out and waved to me
When it had reached the top.

Like it did from the hollow.

 I saw a boy rolling a hoop up the road, 
 
 His little bare hands were red with cold, 
 
 But his brown hair blew backward in the southwest 
 wind. 
 
 (Dear God! He screamed when he saw my awful 
 woe-spent eyes.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 I met a woman in the lane; 
 
 Her burden was heavy as it is always, but today 
 her step was light, 
 
 And a smile drenched the tired look away from her 
 eyes. 
 
 (Dear God, she had dreams of vengeance for her 
 slain mate, 
 
 Perhaps the west wind has blown the mist of hate 
 from her heart, 
 
 The dead man was cruel to her, you know that, 
 
 God.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 My feet spurn the ground now, instead of dragging 
 on the bitter road. 
 
 I laugh in my throat as I see the grass greening be- 
 side the patches of snow 
 
 (Dear God, those were wild fears. Can there be 
 hate when the southwest wind is blowing?) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 The crisp brown hedges stir with the bustle of bird 
 Wings. 
 
 There is business of building, and songs from brown 
 thrush throats 
 
 As the bird-carpenters make homes against Valen- 
 tine Day. 
 
 (Dear God, could they build me a shelter in the 
 hedge from the icy winds that will come 
 with the dark?) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 I sped through the town this morning. The florist 
 shops have put yellow flowers in the win- 
 dows, 
 
 Daffodils and tulips and primroses, pale yellow 
 flowers 
 
 Like the tips of her fingers when she waved me that 
 frightened farewell. 
 
 And the women in the market have stuck pussy wil- 
 lows in long necked bottles on their stands. 
 
 (Willow trees are kind, Dear God. They will not 
 bear a body on their limbs.) 
 
 April is on the way! 
 
 The soul within me cried that all the husk of in- 
 difference to sorrow was but the crust of ice 
 with which winter disguises life; 
 
 It will melt, and reality will burgeon forth like the 
 crocuses in the glen. 
 
 (Dear God! Those thoughts were from long ago. 
 When we read poetry after the day’s toil. 
 and got religion together at the revival 
 meeting.) 
 
 A pril is on the way! 
 
 The infinite miracle of unfolding life in the brown 
 February fields. 
 
 (Dear God, the hounds are baying!) 
 
 Murder and wasted love, lust and weariness, deceit 
 and vainglory—what are they but the spent 
 breath of the runner? 
 
 (God, you know he laid hairy red hands on the 
 
 golden loveliness of her little daffodil body) 
 Hate may destroy me, but from my brown limbs 
 will bloom the golden buds with which we 
 once spelled love. 
 (Dear God! How their light eyes glow into black 
 pin points of hate!) 
 
 A pril is on the way! 
 
 Wears are made in April, and they sing at Easter 
 time of the Resurrection. 
 
 Therefore I laugh in their faces. 
 
 (Dear God, give her strength to join me before her 
 
 . golden petals are fouled in the slime!)

In a stranger's arms,
Dreaming of you
For a God-given moment--

“The sea compels me; sister I must go
Nay! Do not hold me,—I’m of age you know!
I am a Breton and of noble birth.
The pathway of the ocean draws me so!”

“But, brother, if you leave, what good am I on earth?
Without you, dear, my life is poor and cold.
Ah! stir not from our fold!
Remain with me until we both are old!
Our mountain life is happy, brother dear.
And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so clear!”

“Upon a vessel which shall bear your name
A captain I’ll return, but still the same.
Within three years we'll own these woods, this land;
And lords of all we'll be, and all will claim.”

“But think,” said she, “what more can you demand?
Our cottage rises from the earth’s brown mold,
And happy, happy is our humble fold.
Remain with me until we both are old! 
Our mountain life is happy, brother dear,
And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so clear!”

But he must leave her though the heavens fall.
Ten lonely years—no word from him no call!
Beside the hearth his sister, his best friend,
Wept, constant, wearing sorrow as a pall.
Then suddenly her grief comes to an end.
One day a sailor, shipwrecked, racked with cold,
Sought shelter.
“You! My brother, grown so old!”
“Yes, sister mine, I’ve come back to the fold.
This mountain life will heal my suffering drear.
And sweetest Brittainy, thy sunlight is so clear!”

 Heard ye of Crispus Attucks,

 Stir the spark within ye, 
 Or Douglass 
 Of the rare and matchless tongue?

 Who moulded a Tuskegee—

 Mean nothing to us,  
 They, nor the unheard causes they espouse.

 Sharing crumbs with dogs; 
 And Job,

GOD nurtures in his garden many fruits.
Some, very slow of growth, become at last
Sweet and enduring. Some put forth their shoots
With hasty promise, bloom and soon are past.
Each has its season and the husbandman
Waits patiently, remembering that each
Must strive within its nature as it can
Its own appointed destiny to reach.
So patiently the eye of faith can see
The nettle-blooms of war and hate increase,
While slowly through the ages grows that tree
Whose leaves are healing and whose fruit is peace.

The Childhood of Jimmy,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"The Town
I lived with my aunt in a small town. There were lots of colored people there. It was a nice town with trees in it and at the end of our street a river and a little house where a colored man sold whisky and sometimes beer .   .   .   My aunt liked our town. She said she always lived there. My uncle liked our town, too .  .  .  He washed his overalls in the backyard on Sundays .   .   .  There were two churches in our town.

The School
There were colored children in the town school. All the little colored children were in one room and the teacher was colored, too. I don’t think she liked
the school.   .   .  When I was in the third grade I went into another room with the white children and the teacher was white, too. I don’t think she liked the school either. She said we were all bad children.  .   .   Sometimes they slapped me in the school.

The Difference
You’re a nigger. You ain’t as good as I am ‘cause you're a nigger.  .  . Paul said that to me but he didn’t mean to hurt me when he said it. He was my friend. We played games together all the time and we went to the woods on Saturdays to look for May apples and
birds . . . He said you ain’t as good as I am. You're a nigger, but he didn’t mean to hurt me.   .   .  I asked my aunt what I should say when Paul said you're a nigger. I liked Paul so I asked my aunt what I should say.

The Soul
God! I ain’t afraid of God! Earl said, and God didn’t strike him dead.  .  .  Come all ye who love the Lord and lay your burdens down. They sang slow in church Sunday morning. It was Revival Day and Earl went up and sat on the mourner’s bench.  .  .  And I went up, too, ashamed . . . Come all ye who love the Lord . . . and my aunt was kneeling down beside me praying.  .  .   and the old folks in the amen-corner were praying .  .  . And the preacher said do you love God? And I said yes. And the preacher said do you accept Him? And I said yes. And I was converted . . . And my aunt got up and the old folks screamed hallelujah and sang glory to the name of the Lord.  .  .  And I went home
and cried in bed because I was ashamed.  .  . I didn’t love God . . . And I was ashamed to lie about I didn’t love God.

The Body
My aunt said be careful about girls.  . . Clarence, next door, was the father of a baby.  .  . Clarence was sixteen years old.  .  .  Clarence was arrested and had to marry the mother
of his baby.  .  .  My aunt said be careful about girls.  .  . I went to her house at four o'clock in the afternoon. She said I should come.  .  . My aunt said be careful about girls.  .  . I didn’t know much about girls.  .  . Her mother worked all day in Mrs. Ronnermann’s kitchen. Her mother didn’t get home until after supper.  .  . My aunt said be careful about girls . . . She said I should come. Her mother didn’t get home until after supper . . . Be careful about girls.

Death
My grandmother died on Thursday.  .  . Grandmother.  .  . I didn’t want her to die on Thursday.  .  . Every Thursday I sold papers and I missed selling papers because she died on Thursday.  .  . Somebody woke me up at three o'clock in the morning because my grandmother was dead. I went outdoors looking for my grandmother.  .  . She wasn’t there. The moon was there, cold and ugly, but no ghost of my g r a n d m o t h e r . . . They wrapped her up in sheets and sent her away to the undertaker’s. I didn’t sell any papers on Thursday.  .  .  missed my grandmother . . . We moved away to another town. I went to another school. I didn’t sell any more papers on Thursdays. I went to work in a big hotel.  .  . I missed my grandmother.

 And make of them a bronze vase, 
 And awide round fountain 
 With a beautiful statue in its center, 
 And a song with a broken heart, 
 And I ask you: 
 Do you understand my dreams? 
 Sometimes you say you do — 
 And sometimes you say you don't. 
 Either way 
 It doesn’t matter. 
 I continue to dream.

I Thought it was Tangiers I Wanter,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"I Know now
That Notre Dame is in Paris.
And the Seine is more to me now
Than a wriggling line on a map
Or a name in travel stories.
I know now
There is a Crystal Palace in Antwerp
Where a hundred women sell their naked bodies,
And the night-lovers of sailors
Wait for men on docks in Genoa.
I know now
That a great golden moon
Like a picture-book moon
Really rises behind palm groves
In Africa,
And tom-toms do beat
In village squares under the mango trees.
I know now
That Venice is a church dome
And a net-work of canals,
Tangiers a whiteness under sun.
I thought
It was Tangiers I wanted,
Or the gargoyles of Notre Dame,
Or the Crystal Palace in Antwerp,
Or the golden palm-grove moon in Africa,
Or a church dome and a net-work of canals.
Happiness lies nowhere,
Some old fool said,
If not within oneself.
It’s a sure thing
Notre Dame is in Paris,—

Day,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"Where most surely comes a day
When all the sweets you've gourged
Will turn your stomach sick
And all the friends you've loved
Will go away
And every gold swift hour
Will be an hour of pain

Will lose their long-held faint perfume

Only your single selves together
Facing a single doom.",March,1927,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For an Indian Screen,Langston Hughes,Hughes,"Clutching at trees and clawing rocks
And panting and climbing
Until he reached the top
A tiger in India
Surmounted a cliff one day
When the hunters were behind him
And his lair was far away.
A black and golden tiger
Climbed a red cliff’s side
And men in black and golden gowns
Sought the tiger's hide.
O, splendid, supple animal:
Against the cliff's red face:
A picture for an Indian screen
Woven in silks of subtle sheen
And broidered in yellow lace,
A picture for an Indian screen
As a prince's gift to some ebony queen

Bulwark (1927),Langston Hughes,Hughes,"You were the last bulwark of my dreams,
And now you, too, have tumbled down into the dust.
You, too, are no more than a broken lie.
   Something
   came between us
   green and slimy
   like sickly laughter
   and a bowl was broken
   from which
   we could not drink thereafter
   and we turned around
   and threw
   the shattered bits
   upon the ground
   and went our separate ways
   into the town
   and a clock
   somewhere in a tower
   boomed out slowly
   hour after hour
   a great cracked

Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.

The bright shining rainbow sweeping back to God at set of sun!

Sweet Love O' Dusk,Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"Bespangled and dipt in fire of stars the robe
I wrap around my aching form and lie
In ecstacy beneath the world-old skies
And stretch my arms to those who lost my love
When they would seek a mine that held the gods
Of every pagan realm; and through my veins
The ancient warmth diffuses riotous
And eager for eternal cooling breath.

For I who wandered through a maze of curse
And knew the scorn of those I strove to aid
Have found a newer realm, a sacred grove
Where I can woo that star-crowned maid of dusk
Who brought to light a brood of sorrow folk
And place on her a wedding ring of flowers
That none but God can break.

Tis good to know
She walks and chants her songs no man can sing
And hear her voice in every scented breeze; 
For she has waited long that I should come
And hid herself among a faithful few
In cave whose seal responds to magic’s charm.
But now that starry scented night has dropt 
To earth she glides to me and clasps me hard
And presses on my lips a natal kiss
And bids me let the curses die; for man
Can weave no curse that lives, nor stay sweet love. 

I revel here a thousand thousand nights
And elves do dance around my wedding couch 
And ever in my arms the maid o’dusk
And ever in my dreams her tender love
That guides me o'er a thousand thousand streams.

Then blow your pipes and let your minstrelsy
Bloom golden ’neath a starry canopy;
For all the years have come and death is cold
And wrapt in shroud and laid in catacomb.

Variations on a Black Theme,S. Miller Johnson,Johnson,"I have seen my little black Nellie gal-all naked!
She was wearing a beach-robe of black and 
     gold over one-piece bathing togs of 
blue and white.
She was strolling and singing and dancing 
     'long a silver sand-clad river bank.
Trimmed with budding cane and tiny-
     leafed drooping willows.

   I saw the tilt of her plump black breast
     Beneath that robe of black and gold
   Would its young beauty stand the test
     Of flames that brown lips hold?

I'd like to take her lithe dark body in my arms 
And gently squeeze from it
Rich juices of poetry and song.
For she's a slim gay gal with a heart and a song and a smile,
With a strut and a love for jazz!

As Nellie was singing and strolling and 
     dancing 'long that silver sand-clad river bank,
She didn't see me sitting over there behind 
     those drooping willows that waved by 
the silver river.
She didn't know I was feasting on the de-
     licious rhythm of her liquid movements….
And the sweet charm of her soft slim body– 
Dark as the depths of Bantu-land
And as near the teeming earth where God is.

Nellie thought she was out there by herself
… nobody peeping.
For she looked as free as the tall slim pines
     brushing bits of white clouds from the
sky on the other side of the silver
     river,
As she skipped along that silver beach,
Her little black feet sinking up to her danc-
     ing ankles in silver sand.

Nellie threw back her head and smiled at her lover, the Sun.
She stretched her snake-like body up towards mighty heavens
She relaxed with a sigh in the arms of the sun-glow.
Ah! thought I, with a thrill and a jump.
The dance to the Sun and the Silver River!

She flung off her robe of black and gold
And danced to the Sun and the Silver River
A dance primitive as the earth, mother of 
     gods.
She sang a song as she danced there in the 
     silver sand–
A song ripe with oldness and teeming with newness, 
     like the god-bearing earth,
'Neath pillared Angkor's mighty shades
     Her palm-like body sways in dance.
Now slow, now mad. The rhythm fades,
     Dissolves itself in air ... By chance
Her flowered tunic falls away,
     (The frantic dance goes on and on)
And shows her flesh in glad array
Adorned with gems from Askalon.
Nellie flung aside her suit of blue and white.
The Sun pretended to hide his face behind a
     little piece of white cloud.
But the sun was just fooling; he looked
     right through that veil of cloud at my
Nellie.
I got kind of jealous when the Sun looked
     at my Nellie with no clothes on.
Nellie danced on.
She shook herself,
Like a doe jumping up from good healthful
     sleep
In shaded woodlands
By singing rivulets
And maiden springs–
Springs that whine like a brown gal longing
     for loving.
Nellie kept singing and dancing,
Singing a song mellow with many years,
     and new,–
Like the great god-bearing earth:
She floats in honey-tinted sighs,
     She trips about on wings of song.
Desire beckons her with cries
     Of, ""Perfect happiness ere long!""
She's frankincense and myrrh, I ween.
     Her countenance is fair.
Her head the proudest ever seen
     Bedecked with silk-black hair.
Nellie's wild black hair fell loose,
Half veiling her beaming black face
Soft as finest chamois.
She lingered wantonly towards the edge of
     the silver water.
And placed her slender dark hands on her
     strong supple hips,
And gazed down upon her unclad self,
Her face aglow with mother-longing,
Like the mighty earth, mother of all the
     great gods of Black Folk.
With golden bracelets 'round her arm,
     A red rose in her hair,
Her soul is autumn-brown and warm.
     A poet's dream is living there.
Her darting, cutting, dashing eyes
     Half-closed, yet full of fire,
Ope wide, then close with mild surprise,
     To trap some some eager sire.
From side to side she swayed her comely hips,
Palm-like beneath the peeping giggling Sun.
Her step was firm, now weak, now pleading
To the Sun, her lover;
Now defiant, now ranting, now expressive of flight
Before her rival The Silver River.
The muscles of her swift black legs were taut,
Ready to run errands for her lover the Sun.
The soft curves of her neck,
The mellow outlines of her back
Flowed clearly . . . then confusedly,
As the dance got faster and faster.
I saw her dimpled knees, like smiling baby's cheeks.
I saw her tender breasts springing regularly,
Tipped with polished bronze,
Teeming with passion,
Pouting for love.
A drooping willow raised his drooping head
To feast his eyes on my Nellie dancing
     there naked on silver sand by the Silver
          River for her lover, the Sun.
I started to get kind of sore.
But I knew the old willow was too old to do any harm,
So I chanted:
     Do not disturb my very own.
     I'll let you stand afar and look
     At her whose soul is wine to me,
     A golden book, a soothing tone.
I saw her warm pert, laughing mouth.
I saw her right red lips
Magnetic, honey-clewed, half-parted,
Uncurtain the tips of her white, white teeth-
White like rice in a red-rimmed ebony bowl!
I saw her eyes smiling through her long black hair
Which hung all loose and lustrous in the Sun-glow.
I heard my Nellie say to her lover the Sun:
""Come love me now, come love me long.""
And I saw the Sun run off giggling behind the clouds.
Nellie shrugged her shoulders
And thrust her fists in her cynical ribs,
And leaned slightly forward,
And sang with the voice of a low-down hag
The song of the Black Fates:
""Dark gal born
Of a dark, dark woman
Ahey!
Sho' bound to see dark days.""
She plunged into the stream and swam against the tide,
While I gazed on, wrapt in celestial bliss, wild-eyed.",May,1927,The Messenger,"A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen, George S. Schuyler",Free Verse,male,"Eroticism, Dance",,New York,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the Shop Gal,S. Miller Johnson,Johnson,"She is a golden faery child.

Sweeps on the Earth and with hard cruel fetters

In the Hospital,Claude McKay,McKay,"After the nights like days, the days like nights,
Crowded with movement, filled and overflowing,
Whirling like circling birds in aimless flights,
Dipping round gilded dome and steepled heights,
Blessed is being here and without knowing
Or caring of the city’s ways and sights.
With peace dearer than love within my breast,
Blessed is being here behind the curtain,
Blessed to know the meaning of real rest,
Where even thought can at its virile best
Be sweet, yet no less militant and certain
Than a fierce eagle folded in its nest.

Far from the petty troubles of the street,
And little men who mouth their little woe,
Blessed is being in this strange retreat,
Blessed the sleepy hours so long and sweet,
That fold me in from life my friend and foe,
With kindly bands about my hands and feet.

Like music blown through tropical corn sheaves,
Blessed the foreign tongue that soothes and charms,
Like golden drops of rain from thick-thatched eaves,
That fall into uplifted tania leaves,
Blessed disease, the bitter scourge, that warms

Mattinata,Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"When I think of the hosts of little ones
Who wake to a birdless dawn,
Who know of no meadow that waits for them,
No pool with its dragon flies
All bathed with the silver of morning light
Like the lights that flash on the pool,
When I think of that trystless waking today—
So far as to meadows and meads,
So far as to tossing billows of wheat,
So far as to millet tides,
So far as to orchards and woods to seek
To swing from the kind sweet trees—
I fear that the dawn’s too rich for my share.
I fear I have robbed some child
Of the fragrance of dew,
Of the birds’ first notes,
Of the warm kind light from God—
All sent in tints of nasturtium blooms—
For the little red hearts of childhood.

The Bird in the Cage,Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"The Bird in the Cage

This poem received Honorable Mention in The Crisis Prize contest of 1926.

I AM not better than my brother over the way,
But he has a bird in the cage and I have not,
It beats its little fretted green wings
Against the wires of its prison all day long.
Backward and forward it leaps,
While summer air is tender and the shadows of leaves
Rock on the ground,
And the earth is cool and heated in spots,
And the air from rich herbage rises teeming,
And gold of suns spills all around,
And birds within the maples
And birds upon the oaks fly and sing and flutter.
And there is that little green prisoner,
Tossing its body forward and up,
Backward and forth mechanically!
I listen for its hungry little song,
Which comes unsatisfying,
Like drops of dew dispelled by drought
O, rose bud doomed to ripen in a bud vase!
O, bird of song within that binding cage!
Nay, I am not better than my brother over the way,
Only he has a bird in a cage and I have not.

At the Pool,Effie Lee Newsome,Newsome,"At the Pool
EFFIE LEE NEWSOME

LIKE to stand right still awhile
Beside some forest pool.
The reeds around it smell so fresh,
The waters look so cool!
Sometimes I just hop in and wade,
And have a lot of fun,
Playing with bugs that dart across
The water in the sun.

They lodge here at this little pool—
All sorts ef bugs and things
That hop about its shady banks,
Or dart along with wings,
Or ‘scamper on the water top,
As water-striders go,
Or strange back-swimmers upside down,
Using their legs to row,
Or the stiff, flashing dragon flies,
The gentle damoiselle,
The clumsy, sturdy water-bugs,
And scorpions as well,
That come on top to get fresh air
From homes beneath the pool,
Where water-boatmen have their nooks,
On pebbles, as a rule.

And then, behold! Kingfisher comes,
That great big royal bird!
To him what is the dragon fly
That. kept the pool life stirred?
Or water-tigers terrible
That murder bugs all day?
Kingfisher comes, and each of these
Would hide itself away!

He swoops and swallows what he will,
A stone-fly or a frog.
Wing’d things rush frightened through the air,
Others to hole and log.
The little pool that held them all
I watch grow very bare,
But fisher knows his hide and seek—
He’ll find some one somewhere!

But gazing on a swarthy sleeping babe
Makes me believe that angels too are black.

While stars above us shone and

Plighted our troth and as loving
We did vow eternal faith.

The beauty of the black opal pierces
The world with laughing lustre
And yet remains serene in the black.

Through all the years, I've heard their wild refrain,
I’ve known the joy of their weird melody,
The fierce, ecstatic tumult of their pain!

Though paler men may never feel their surge,
My songs will bear their burthen! I shall know
Their fervent, fiery passion and their urge!

Nocturne of the Wharves (1928),Arna Bontemps,Bontemps,"All night they whine upon their ropes and boom
Against the dock with helpless prows :
These little ships that are too worn for sailing
Front the wharf but do not rest at all.
Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think,
No doubt, of China and of bright Bombay.
And they remember islands of the East,
Formosa, and the mountains of Japan
They think of cities, ruined, by the sea
And they are restless, sleeping at the wharf.
Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think
No less of Africa. An east wind blows
And salt spray sweeps the unattended decks.
Shouts of dead men break upon the night.
The captain calls his crew and they respond
The little ships are dreaming—land is near.
But mist comes up to dim the copper cast.
Mist dissembles images of the trees.
The captain and his men alike are lost.
And their shouts go down in the rising sound of waves.
* * * * * 
Ah little ships, I know your weariness
I know the sea-green shadows of your dream.
For I have loved the cities of the sea,
And desolations of the old days I
Have loved: I was a wanderer like you
And I have broken down before the wind.",May,1928,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,,male,Travel-Migration-Great Migration,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arna_Bontemps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still I am Marveling,Jonathan H. Brooks,Brooks,"My friend, you marvel how this thing can be,
A blackened bard is told to sing; and |
Am moved to supplement you:
I muse why And when Apollo’s rare proclicity;
How he can muster ample nerve to try
This way of beauty, knowing full well, Ay!
How, begging, Homer died. I dimly see,
Since it is proved that dye of any hue
Does not impair the essence of a thing.
How two of equal gifts and chance may do
An equal deed. Still I am marvelling—
How one black poet ploughs the whole day long
And burns the oil of midnight for a song.

Thoughts of Death,Sterling A. Brown,Brown,"Thoughts of death
Crowd over my happiness
Like dark clouds
Over the silver sickle of the moon.
Death comes to some
Like a grizled gangster
Clubbing in the night
To some
Like an obstinate captain
Steadily besieging barriers
To some
Like a brown adder
Lurking in violet speckled underbrush
To some
Like a gentle nurse
Taking their toys and stroking their hot brows.
Death will come to you, I think
Like an old shrewd gardener
Culling his rarest blossom ...",August,1928,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",Free Verse,male,,,New York,Predom. Black,https://scalar.lehigh.edu/african-american-poetry-a-digital-anthology/sterling-a-brown-sterling-brown-sterling-allen-brown-author-page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Prayer,Mae V. Cowdery,Cowdery,"I saw a dark boy
     Trudging on the road
(Twas’ a dreary road Blacker than night).
     Oft times he'd stumble
And stagger 'neath his burden
     But still he kept trudging
Along that dreary road.

I heard a dark boy
     Singing as he passed
Oft times he'd laugh
     But still a tear
Crept thru his song,
     As he kept trudging
Along that weary road .

I saw a long white mist roll down
     And cover all the earth
(There wasn't even a shadow
     To tell it was night).
And then there came an echo . . . .
 . . . . Footsteps of a dark boy
Still climbing on the way.

A song with its tear
     And then a prayer
From the lips of a dark boy
     Struggling thru the fog.
Oft times I'd hear

     The lashing of a whip
And then a voice would cry to heaven
     “Lord! . . . Lord!
     Have mercy! . . . . mercy!”
And still that bleeding body
     Pushed onward thru the fog .
Song . . . . Tears . . . . Blood . . . . Prayer
     Throbbing thru the mist.

The mist rolled by
     And the sun shone fair,
Fair and golden
     On a dark boy . . . . cold and still
High on a bare bleak tree
     His face upturned to heaven
His soul upraised in song
     “Peace. . . . Peace
     Rest in the Lord.”

Oft times in the twilight
     I can hear him still singing
As he walks in the heavens,
     A song without a tear
A prayer without a plea.

Lord, lift me up to the purple sky
     That lays its hand of stars
Tenderly on my bowed head
     As I kneel high on this barren hill.
My song holds naught but tears
     My prayer is but a plea
Lord take me to the clouds
     To sleep . . . to sleep.

To keep me warm.

I want to sell my soul

Till cool, dewed grass held quivering limbs
And breath was the pain I had;
I was lost in a night-black wood,
And heard a clear birdsong:
Dropping in weariness, I dreamt
That walking I found the dawn—
The reedy flute was under the hill,
Each went back to his task.

We dropped each needful mask
Hiding the child-face that must light

Long Remembering,Ethel Caution Davis,Davis,"If  I should go to sleep to-night
Knowing I ne'er should waken,
I would not be dismayed.
My soul, glad for release ,
Would wing its way unto a long remembering

Of mornings spent upon the Siasconsett strand
Watching the sun rise
Dripping red spray from ocean's eastern rim.
Of hours on Narragansett's craggy coast
When, perched in solitude upon a rock,
Feet dipping in the spray,
I listened to the waves
Beat their high sounding paean on the shore.

Of evenings in mid-ocean when the moon
Laddered its path of gold
From sky down o'er the waves
To where I stood ship-bound
Trying to quench undying thirst
With wonder of the night.

Of dusk in distant balsam wood
When nature poured her evensong
From thrushes ' throat.

Of moments with a cardinal—
He perched upon a swaying pine ,

I tip-toe on the sod—
Talking to each other of happiness and God.

Of blue flags by a Carolina stream,
Of dogwood tracing petals pink
Against a silver sky.

Of flowers peeping through June snow at Scheideg;
Of Spietz reflected in the Thunensee;
Of English gardens
And purple heather hemming in the Scottish lochs

Of Capri's grotto blue
And cedars silhouetted against the Carmel sea.
Of lacy spires etched against the sky
Of Chartres and Senlis, St. Patrick's and Milan.

Of music in a child's unstudied laughter;
Of unexpected handclasps by the way.

If I should go to sleep to-night
Knowing I ne'er should waken
I would not be dismayed.
My pagan soul, if thus it be.
Clothed only in such robes as these
Would wing its way into Eternity
Asking that afterlife be long enough
For such remembering.

Fighters,Allison Davis,Davis,"These of the coal-black faces

Fisherman, washerwoman,
Quietly shutting themselves off From the pool-room loafers.
Unbroken
By the salt spume of the sea,
Tight-lipped against the whispering fears of age,
He holds her laughing.
In his keen eyes
The gleam of one who knows he must endure
All shifting winds,
And hate
Of deep-embittered sons of slaving race,
Must outreach
The hunger of insatiate women,
And broken nets at sea.
Her brave face
Softens in a smile 
And light of youth's long hopes and passion
Sunk away.
But she has seasoned in her proper time
And grown to mellow laughter.
Strong,
Like some far runner turning with new vigor

Against the tearings of untimely births,
And sweating steam of clothes;

Against the pleading smiles
Of brutal, melancholy,

Sustained you, 
When, worn out by late vigils
With the sick, poor and black,
You had to crawl
On hands and knees
To those who trusted you,
Alone.

Physician

You find real pleasure in your work—
Taking liberties when you examine women,
And joking about it later.

You prosper
By prescribing dope to the slum Negroes
For medicine,
And taking their money with no serious effort to help them.

When you have made your “pile”,
You will move as far away from the Negro section
As you can go.

Minister

You have something in you
Which has made you feel the Church
A bigger thing than yourself,—
A Baptist church,—
And which has made you go months without salary,
So that the Church might be saved;

Something
Which has made your talk
Like a friend’s silent confidence,
And your face unlike other men’s,
And made even your wife
Respect you.

Do you wish to call it “God”?
I know you will speak it quietly.

Minister

You make your living
By talking through a service 
About God,
And rejoice equally
To get a marriage or 
A funeral.

Have you convinced yourself yet
That this whole business of a church 
And confident speaking to God, with you leading, 
Is not a madman’s game?

And aren’t they fools to be paying you a salary 
To speak to God for them,
When your thoughts are always
Of a pretty wife
And a larger church?

Lawyer

You brought home your northern education
To bleed the poor “n*****s” you scorn,
Threatening frantic blacks with jail,
And pretending to save them from
The Bugaboo of the Law.
From one love-blind mother,
You boast,
You got all she had,
Three hundred dollars,
To keep her son out of jail.

Well,
Your new car
Is all you have,
And in that your white-skinned wife
Loves her college boy;

While the stupid, black mother
You broke,
Scrubs floors to keep
Her son.

College Girl

You spent every week-end
In all-night liquor parties with your “man”;
You spent the money your mother
Feared to borrow on her home,
Not on books, but on dresses
To make you the belle of fraternity dances.

And you didn’t learn a damned thing
Except the unnecessary tricks of loving,
And ten animalistic dances.

You will teach the Negro students farther south
What you learned.


Northern - College Girl

The chief thing
You learned from your northern training
Was how to be a sycophant with men,
And excuse your parasitism
By calling it love.

Now you teach high school in the week,
And wisely go to your “man” out of town
For the week-ends.

I pity you.
I know how often you’ve wished
You were dead,
When you faced
Your mother,
After those week-ends.

College Athlete

You spend your winters
Juggling basket-balls
And women.
You won’t work,
You won't study,
You won’t marry;

But you have four “letters”,
And a fraternity pin.

College education
Of a hundred like you every year
Will bring the race along rapidly.

Gospel For Those Who Must,Allison Davis,Davis,"The Leader
One lone bird,
Small and brown,
Singing in the morning
One clear note,

Singing to the high church-steeple
With its needle spire
Pointing to the infinite heaven,
Merging with the far blue sky,

In the fresh vigor of the morning
His one clear call,
Harsh, unvarying, but
Beautiful.

Oh, all sweeter, fuller singers,
All loud and busy noises of the mid-day
Drown his voice;

But in the quiet cool of dusk,
By the spire pointing to the far blue vault,
I hear him singing still,

Lonely
With his one unfaltering call,
Beautiful
With his one clear note
Following the spire.

Fighters
These of the coal-black faces
Confide low-voiced,—
Fisherman, washerwoman,
Quietly shutting themselves off
From the pool-room loafers.

Unbroken
By the salt spume of the sea,
Tight-lipped against the whispering fears of age,
He holds her laughing,

In his keen eyes the gleam of one who knows
He must endure all shifting winds, and hate
Of deep-embittered sons of slaving race, Must outreach
The hunger of insatiate women,
And broken nets at sea.

Her brave face
Softens with a smile,
And light of youth’s long hopes and passion,
Sunk away;—

But she has seasoned in her proper time
And grown to mellow laughter,
Strong
Like some far runner turning with new vigor
Home.

Now she is firm against
The tearings of untimely births,
And sweating steam of clothes;
Firm now, at last, against
The pleading smiles
Of brutal melancholy,
Rich-voiced men.

To All Negroes Everywhere
I know lone dwellers on a barren farm,
Who daily drink from acrid waters, rank
With yellow scum and sickening taste,—
Minerals from the dark, deep-hidden earth.

This bitterness they change for health and power,
And stomachs sweetened to their vulgar food,
And now no longer wish
A long draught from the cold, sweet well.

A Dark Actress -- Somewhere,Blanche Taylor Dickinson,Dickinson,"They watched her glide across the stage,
Each one poised with breath a tip- toe,
Felt his soul strings link with hers,
Loosed his heart and let it go
To her brown and tapering fingers,
Crushing it into a ball,
Throwing it with accuracy,
Smiling as she saw it fall.
Bending willow-like to music,
As a bird in willows, singing
Of a love that's so much fancy
From a dream marsh ever springing.
""Art,"" the critic said next day,
And people flocked to see her play.
Laid their fair hearts at her feet–
But never saw her on the street.

The New Negro,Elsie Taylore Du Trieuille,Du Trieuille,"“Hey there, Bub! I say!”
Silence. (“He knows my name.’’)
“Hey George! This way!”
Silence. (“Same, old, game.”)
“Hey, darky! You!!”
Silence. (“Same, old game.” )
“T’ll be damned if tain’t true!
Nigger showing off, posing offense
At a name. Do you think I’d ‘Mister’ you!
Black beast! Any name
For you'd be an honor. Who
Looks at you, sees a cringing, tame 
Beast. Intelligence! Bah!
Blunt as pig iron. Black soul!
What’s in you to respect! Ha!
Ha! I could take the whole
Of your race and dam the oceans with its refuse!
Stinking flotsam! Black beast!
God! Who has use
For your carcass!”

So, at least,
Was this white man’s thought.

But out of this stinking flotsam, God
Wrought a young knighthood.
Sworn to their vows, with flashing sword
And dazzling shield, they stood—
A new order of Negro Youth, eager
For the quest of the Guarded Heights,
God bade them, “Go forward! No meager
Whims of men shall put to flight
Your soul’s great force. Wear
My favors, Vision and Love.
Evil shall glower, a few shall dare
To mock; but steadfast above
All pettiness, you shall stand.

“New Negro, sing your soul's own song,
Holy, majestic, grand.
Your notes shall lead a jeering throng
From baseness to nobility.
Dip your gilt-edged pen in the wellspring
Of your heart. With swift agility,
Fling word on word to pierce and sting
As the rapier thrust, men’s hearts.
Your daring pen shall slowly lessen
Studied, insidious plots
Of prejudice and inhuman oppression.
Open the flood-gate of your vivid soul.
On crested waves of creative
Genius, unveiled beauty shall roll
Forth, to transform, to give
New life to barren canvass. Men
Shall gaze astounded and their
Eager hands shall reach out then,
Not to despoil, but to share,
To possess the lofty inspiration
Pure art alone can give.

“New Negro, in this generation
You shall fully live.
‘The old order changeth’. Not
Mold of face, nor color of skin
Shall conquer the cruel heart
Of race tyranny, or bigotry, its kin.
They shall perish by your flashing sword
Of ability. Your shield, brightly 
Emblazoned with fine achievement, shall afford
Invulnerable armor for unsightly
Barbs of asinine abuse. Knights
Of the order of New Negro Youth,
You shall reach the Guarded Heights 
With weapons of integrity and truth.”

A Prayer (1928),Alice Dunbar-Nelson,Dunbar-Nelson,"Lord, keep my soul from bitterness and sting,
My heart from searing scorch and crushing blight;
I would not, by my gloom, obscure the light
Which might illumine rocks where others cling.
Far better, Lord, my eager hands should bring
Some little gift with my heart's blood a-dight,
To this great good. Ere I shall merge in night,
Let me not grovel, Lord, aloft, I'd sing.
For those who stand with twisted fear-clenched hands,
And heart's red chalice brimming full of hate,
See life's gold gates swing open far too late,
And peace go streaming by with hurried stare.

Episode ,Jessie Fauset,Fauset,"The memory of you is slight in my mind,
But poignant.
Like a sole, unrepeated experience,
Like the wheeling flight of a gull,
Like smoke hanging high in the blue
In vaporish traceries,—
Without sound, but significant
As a thunder-preceding lull.

A column of sand-pipers
Marching meticulously
Over the sedge-strewn floor of the beach;
Slight and graceful, unswerving
As war-going fifers;
Persistent, purposeful, sure,—
And just beyond reach!
Easily, far too easily
That picture fades from my senses;
Yet if once I recall it
There springs to my mind perfection;
Perfection of sky and sun
And ocean and weather
Promised fulfilment, of yearning,
Assurance of heaven's protection.
So you. The memory of you
Is slight but poignant;

Actions ignoble;
Leaving me peace and completeness.—

I Am Africa,Walter Everette Hawkins,Hawkins,"I am Africa:
     Black as the wealth of my coal mines,
     Black as the murk of my midnight;
     I built Timbuctoo and Karnak,—
     The temples of Isis and Osiris,
     The Alphabet

I am Africa:
     I am the Sphinx and the Pyramids,
     The rub and riddle of the universe,
     Defying time and the elements.
     Upon the bosom of my prairies
     I shelter the caravan of nations,—
     I lull them to sleep in my midnight,—
     I bury them in my Saharas.
     From the pinnacle of my pyramids
     I laughed at the legions of Caesar.
     Out of the night of my midnight
     Arose the hut of the Zulu,
     The wigwam and kraal of the Bushmen,
     The dynasties of Rameses and the Pharaohs,
     The palaces and temples of the Ptolemies.
     My daughters were queens in old Sheba,
     My sons were the kings of old Egypt; 
     On the banks of the Nile I have reared them,
     In immortal art I embalmed them.

I am Africa:
     Black as the night of my coal mines,
     Black as the deep of my midnight,
     Prometheus on the rock of adversity,
     The nations I feed on my vitals,
     I give food to the tables of monarchs, 
     My coal warms the palaces of princes,
     My diamonds deck the bosoms of queens,—
     The queens in the palaces of London,
     The salons of Brussels and of Paris,
     The salons of Berlin
 
I am Africa:
     On the fertile banks of the Congo
     My sorrow in song I have lifted;
     In the cane brakes and cornfields of Texas
     My sorrow songs still I am singing,
     I sleep ’neath the stars in the jungle,
     I am brother to the beasts and the leopard,
     The lion’s strength moves in my sinews,
     In my bones is the iron of my Africa.
     I worship the life-giving sunlight,
     Oblations I give to the moon,
     My gods are of stone and of iron—
     No greater than these have I found.
     I build temples which I may not enter,
     I garner the harvest but eat not;
     I gather the cotton in the Southland,—
     Give grist to the mills in the Northland,—

I am Africa:
     I laid down my life at Fort Pillow,
     My blood’s on the Common of Boston;
     I died on the flag at Fort Wagner,
     My bones lie bleaching in Flanders. 
     They lynch me and burn me in Georgia,
     My body is fuel in Texas,
     They jim-crow me even in Washington, 
     They mock me even from the White House.
     Black as the wealth of my coal mines, 
     Black as high noon of my midnight,—
     I am the nimbus of nations,
I am Africa.

Fiat Lux,Helene Johnson,Johnson,"Her eyes had caught a bit of loveliness—
A flower blooming in the prison yard.
She ran to it and pressed it to her lips,
This Godsend of a land beyond the walls;
She drank its divine beauty with her kiss—
A guard wrested the flower from her hand,
With awful art, her humble back laid bare—
Soft skin, and darker than a dreamless night;
He tossed aside the burden of her hair.
“I'll teach you to pick flowers in this yard.
They ain't for niggers.” He began to flog.
Her pale palmed hands grasped the thin air in quest.
Until, like two antalgic words, they fell,
And whispered something to her bleeding breast.
And she forgot the misery of her back.
Somehow she knew that God, HER God was there—
Thai what was pain was but her striped flesh.
Her soul, inviolate, was havened in prayer.
On a cross of bigotry she was crucified
Because she was not white. And like her Father
On the holyrood, whispered, “Forgive”.
And in her eyes there shone a Candlemas light.
He flung the whip into the flower bed,
He did not even note that she was dead. ",December,1928,Opportunity,"Charles S. Johnson, Countee Cullen",,female,"Religion, Lynching and Racialized violence, Incarceration",,New York,Predom. Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Mother o' Dusk and Her Babe,Fenton Johnson,Johnson,"I look and that I see appeals to me
As does the manger Babe to Christian man,
For she who mothered long another’s brood
Upon her lap in rapture holds a child
That came from deep travail to claim her love.

Upon its lips she prints a deathless kiss
And holds against her breast its trembling form 
And through the night she croons a strange old song
That tells the world, “Behold, I have my own.”

For she is mother now, that once was such
A cruel world with jibes derided her
And asked her, “Where are those you brought to light?
Where all those hopes you said were yours to give?”

I hear this turbaned mother plead, “O world, 
My hopes have shaped themselves in flesh o’ brown
And all my deeds have given light to eyes
That grasp its infant hour of wonderment.
Take now my suckling, let it live for thee
And when its manhood breaks its spirit’s bound
It shall defend thee, succour thee and love
The good that through the ages thou hast served.”

And when the child in sleep would close its eyes
This strong young mother lifts with tenderness
This proselyte to all the joys and woes
An ancient world would give to test its own
And lays it snug within its trundle bed
And lets the moonlight play upon its form.

When Sampson Sings,James Edward McCall,McCall,"Black Sampson is a singing man;

A steel guitar is in his hands,
     And in his mouth, a song.

He shuffles up and down the streets,
     Led by a little child;
His voice is vibrant, deep and loud,
     Like the sea when the winds are wild.

There’s sunshine, laughter, pain, and tears,
     In the songs black Sampson sings—
The slave’s sad wail, the warrior’s shout,
     And the laughter of rippling springs.

There’s something in his voice that clings,
     Like Ethiopia’s arms,
Which holds the strength of Pyramids,
     And great Sahara’s charms.
When Sampson sings he holds the throng
     With the spell of his magic bars,
Which thrill like the sound of tom-tom drums,
     On the Congo, under the stars.

In these amazing times with fine amaze,
Threading the tides of space that roll between

And grand old prejudices crumble down,
That ancient pride in warring breasts has stirred.

Of legioned bigots leagued by fear and spurred
To crush thy truth, but more the shouting clown,

To gnaw through all stubborn resistance a way

Abased at the feet of the gods of their despoilers.

Not for dumb driven diggers of ditches,
Not for dust-choked pickers of cotton,
Nor straining loaders of carriers,
Not for the fettered multitudes
That worship at their shrines
Do the gods perform their miracles.

Seeking balms for their sores
The persecuted receive but the sting of irritants;
Seeking contentment, but the bitterness of denial.
With wounds recrudescent,
With minds uncontent
They turn yet
To the gods of the privileged.

In their cloistered sanctuaries
The worshipped stare with poker faces
At the antics of the dust.

We know but that
God made man,
And that Africa is a land of jungies–

That nights have been dark
And like a million stars
We have grinned
Thru them all.

It is strange
That we should know Love,
We who have gasped for breath
Amid poisonous fumes of hate
And have sucked
The bitter breast of scorn;
It is strange
That we too
Should know the joy
Of kisses.

Our mouths have sung
The Lord’s song
In a strange land,
And our harp strings have vibrated
With new tunes.

We must find a new prayer
To pray,
The same words have grown dull 
To the ears of God:
We must find a new prayer 
For the God of the sun 
And steel girders,
We must build stronger altars
To the God of skyscrapers.

How quickly this dream has ended!
Palm trees are waving
On the banks of the Congo
Where grass huts still hide dusky bodies
From the sun;
And there are voices
Crying aloud in the wilderness—
There are voices in the jungles 
That echo thru the night
As ours did

That you sprang from a Nordic serf.",June,1928,Black Opals,"Nellie R. Bright, Arthur Huff Fauset, Allan Randal Freelon, James H. Young",,male,,,Philadelphia,Predom. Black,https://philly.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer-w-e-waring/137756079/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jubilee Singers,Mary J.  Washington,Washington,"Mellow notes,
Fluted 
Vibrant with the echoes of an old forgotten song;
Sweet and low,
Swinging so,
Breaking forth like summer winds that gaily sweep along.

Harmony,
Melody
Blending like the colours of the rosy-fingered dawn,
Measured time,
Tones sublime
Gentle as an April shower pattering on a lawn.

Bass alone,
A swelling moan,
“All you little chillen bettah git on bo’d!”
“Bye and bye,
B’yon’ de sky,
Ise sholy gwine a lay down mah heavy, heavy load.”

Smiles and tears,
Hopes and fears,
“Lawd ha’ mercy on me an’ I hope I'll jine de ban’.”
“Glory hallelu!
Gwine a put on mah shoe,
And walk all ober heb’n jus’ a singin’ thro’ de lan.”

Mellow notes,
Fluted throats,
Whispering the chorus of an old forgotten song,
Sweet and low,
Swinging so,
Sighing like the evening breeze that gently sweeps along.

When a Jazz Band Plays,Roscoe Wright,Wright,"I see shining black hair smoothed back
on round dark foreheads.
And agile bodies sway, from side to side,
like trees cradled by a rhythmic wind.
Tom-toms thud ... thud ... thud.
I hear the soft gurgle of rippling waters;
the jubilation of the jungle moon, laughing
with the stars; and the howl of the jackal
in the tangled bush.
I hear the soft, pure music of angels,
and the loud quick cacophony of demons,
blended in concert all together.",June,1928,Saturday Evening Quill,Eugene Gordon,,male,"Music, Jazz",,,Predom. Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Portrait ,James H. Young,Young,"YOU
are like a melody
that comes floating to me ,
over the quiet of a summer day
when all is calm and
noon-day zephyrs trill along
warmed by the glowing sun,
a ball of gilded fire,
. . . a song.
YOU
are like a garden in the spring
when the buds ache as they
painfully-—joyfully—burst the
bonds that held them fast during winter,
for their arrival is a beautiful thing
and so is the awakening of life
... to a maid.
YOU
are spring—
the springtime of life, for
your eyes glow as life's piteous—
joyous—aching—ecstatic secrets
are unfurled to you;
you live again the same joy,
the same life, that the trees live
and die with them—as they do.",May,1928,The Carolina Magazine,Lewis Alexander,Free verse,male,,,"Chapel Hill, NC",Predom. White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
